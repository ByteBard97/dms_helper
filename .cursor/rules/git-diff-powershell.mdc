        - **Problem:** Directly piping `git diff` output in PowerShell (e.g., `git diff | cat`) can fail due to PowerShell's object handling and parameter binding errors with `Get-Content` (aliased as `cat`). Attempts like `git --no-pager diff | cat` may also fail.
        - **Solution:** Use a temporary file to capture the output reliably.
          - **Recommended Command:**
            ```powershell
            git diff | Out-File -FilePath temp_diff.txt -Encoding utf8; Get-Content temp_diff.txt; Remove-Item temp_diff.txt
            ```
          - **Explanation:** This command redirects the raw `git diff` output to `temp_diff.txt` (ensuring UTF-8 encoding), then reads the file content back using `Get-Content`, and finally cleans up the temporary file. This avoids the pitfalls of direct PowerShell piping for this command.
