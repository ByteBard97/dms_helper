# **Chapter 7: The Nether Sea**

"My sojourn into the Nether Sea was a time *of joyful awakening. The Lady of Dreams dotes on her most loyal servants like a jealous mother, but she relentlessly tortures those who defy her. Surrounded on all sides by such death and darkness, one cannot help but feel alive."*

—Chondrus, Servant of Lutheria

The Nether Sea is dark and dangerous. Its inky waters are all that remain of the raw material that the gods used to fashion the world at the dawn of time. This sea of cosmic matter continues to exist for reasons that are hidden even from the gods. The sea is littered with rocky islands and rapids, and the islands are covered in strange, twisted trees and colossal forms.

Although the Nether Sea is located within a vast underground cavern, the sky above is filled with colorful stars and galaxies. The cavern roof above the Nether Sea is almost a half-mile above the water. It is lined with vast lodes of silver and mithral. These deposits reflect the light that emanates from the stars, which are actually magical rifts connected to the Astral Plane.

The Nether Sea is a vast prison vault where the gods have hidden ancient weapons and powerful creatures that have no place in the world above. It is also the domain of the Titan Lutheria, the Lady of Dreams. She travels the Nether Sea on her throne ship, a great bronze vessel called *Hypnos*, which is harnessed and pulled by Talieus, one of her ancient siblings.

#### **Connected to the Underdark**

The Nether Sea is connected to the vast network of tunnels and caverns that makes up the world's Underdark. Sometimes creatures from the Underdark will stumble into the realm of the Nether Sea, but without a powerful ship like the *Ultros*, they are unable to make it very far before succumbing to the chaos of its primordial waters.

# **Traveling to the Nether Sea**

There are two ways to get to the Nether Sea. Neither of these methods are well known, even among the gods. They must be discovered through research or by seeking out extremely wise creatures, such as sphinxes.

#### **The Dead Falls**

The River Lethe empties into a huge rift called *The Dead Falls*, which descends all the way to the Nether Sea. This

#### **Charybdis, The Ravening Maw**

The great whirlpool known as *Charybdis* in the Forgotten Sea can transport a ship to the Nether Sea. Very few ships have ever returned from this journey. This is because the dark waters of the Nether Sea quickly eat away the wooden hulls of most ships.

## **Arriving in the Nether Sea**

When the heroes first arrive in the Nether Sea, read the following narrationt text:

After a few moments of disorientation, you assess your new surroundings. Monotonous black waves and alien skies stretch for as far as the eye can see. The stars are strange and unrecognizable. In stark contrast to the roiling oceans above, everything here is deathly silent. The smell of briney seawater has been replaced with a pervasive metallic odor. You can hear something sizzling against the hull of your ship.

If the heroes arrived here by sailing through the massive whirlpool of *Charybdis*, then they appear several miles in a random direction from the whirlpool's location in the Nether Sea (N1).

#### **Primordial Waters**

The Nether Sea is dangerous for many reasons, but the water itself is the most immediate risk. For one thing, the waters are acidic, and each day, they inflict 30 damage to the ship's hull. The *Ultros* has been magically protected from the waters of the Nether Sea, so it only takes 5 acid damage per day.

*Primordial Whales.* Massive, whale-like creatures sometimes surface in the Nether Sea. Ships that draw too close to them risk capsizing in their wake. These gargantuan beasts don't react to attacks unless they take more than 100 damage, and then they simply submerge beneath the waters once more. The whale creatures have AC 22 and are immune to most conditions: blinded, charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned. They have unlimited uses of *legendary resistance*.

*Drinking the Water.* Anyone who drinks the seawater or submerges themselves are immediately affected by the warping effects of the cosmic matter. The first time someone interacts with the water, the effects wear off after one hour. The second time they touch the water, the effects last one day. The third time, the effects become permanent. Re-roll the effect each time.

#### **Effects of the Primordial Waters**

#### **Leaving the Nether Sea**

Leaving the Nether Sea is easier than getting here. The *Charybdis* whirlpool is the most obvious way to leave. Ships that sail into *Charybdis* from the Nether Sea will defy physics and sail upwards to the roof of the enormous cavern. The ship emerges a few miles from the whirlpool on the surface of the Cerulean Gulf.

*Control Water.* The *control water* spell can also be used to leave the Nether Sea. If cast upon the primordial waters, the effects will be much different than if it had been cast on the surface. Instead of creating a whirlpool, the spell will create a massive spout of water. Effectively, the spell can be used to create a temporary *Charybdis* at any location in the Nether Sea.

# **KEY LOCATIONS**

## **N1. Charybdis**

Just ahead, the Nether Sea breaks into a churning maelstrom of incomprehensible height. Primordial waters churn and gush thousands of feet into the air, vanishing into the darkness of the sky above.

This is an inverted whirlpool known as *Charybdis*. Sailing into it will deposit a ship on the surface of the Forgotten Sea, a few miles away from the gargantuan whirlpool. There is, however, a 5% chance that any ship entering *Charybdis* will be utterly annihilated by the cosmic forces that power it. In this case, the crew will find themselves clinging to wreckage in the Cerulean Gulf. Depending on their actions as the ship is swept upwards, they may be able to salvage their equipment.

# **N2. The River Lethe**

Your vessel drifts towards what appears to be a heavy rain storm. Strangely, no strong winds can be felt and the nearby waves remain calm. The "storm" does not seem to move. It remains in one place and seems to be confined to a narrow area. The falling rain smells fresh, and lacks the acidic odor of the surrounding waters.

The River Lethe falls from the ceiling of the Nether Sea cavern above, starting from the *Dead Falls*. By this point, it is like torrential freshwater rain.

Lutheria sails into this constant rainstorm every day so that she can keep her gardens properly watered. Therefore, staying close to the River Lethe's falls is an excellent way to find and confront Lutheria. See *Lutheria's Barge* at the end of this section for details.

# **N3. Titan Island**

Your ship approaches a small craggy island dominated by gray mountains and black, rocky beaches. Among the mountains stand three incredibly lifelike statues which are similar in scale to the great colossi of Mytros. Each depicts a muscular man in a pose suggesting shock, their faces revealing a combination of fear and rage. Iron chains bind their immobile limbs and are anchored in the surrounding landscape.

Three ancient Titans are petrified on this island. They are siblings of Sydon and Lutheria, and all three tower to 50 feet in height. Two of them are entirely inert, but one still has the ability to speak. If this statue is approached, its eyes open and its head turns slightly toward whoever has come near. Dust rains down as it strains against the magic that petrifies its body.

The speaking titan is quite mad and doesn't even remember its name, although it knows that it was betrayed and trapped by Sydon and Lutheria. It also knows a few secrets that could be used against Sydon or Lutheria:

**• Lutheria is insane**. Sydon once tried to cure his sister by forging weapons from the psychic energy of her madness (*Hall of Armaments*, H6). These weapons may be especially effective against her.

- **• Lutheria has a warped sense of humor**. She likes to tell jokes. She sews your mouth shut if you don't laugh at her jokes. It's *always* better to laugh at her jokes.
- **• Lutheria loves to play games**. She especially loves the Royal Game (the *game of twenty squares*). Challenging her to the game can put her in a better mood, but you should always let her win.
- **• Lutheria roams the Nether Sea**. Lutheria's barge is almost impossible to find unless she chooses to reveal herself to you. However, she takes an interest in any threat to her domain. For example, the *Gargantuan Cubes* (N6) are prisons for powerful weapons. If the heroes can awaken one of the imprisoned weapons, the noise would echo across the entire Nether Sea and summon Lutheria to them. The Titan knows the word that unlocks *The Prison Cube*. He will whisper this almost unpronounceable primordial word to anyone who asks him for it. Whoever hears the word gains a random short-term madness (see the *Game Master's Guide*), but they cannot say the word until they stand before the locked entrance. The word remains in their mind until they speak it, and then they will forget it.
- **• The waters of the Nether Sea are strange**. One must be cautious with the waters here. Spells that manipulate water, such as *control water,* may have unpredictable effects.

#### **The Forgotten Titans**

For more information about the lost siblings of Sydon and Lutheria, refer to the *War of the Titans* in the *Secrets and Myths* appendix.

# **N4. The Mirror Prison**

Dim lights dance upon the horizon. As your ship moves closer, you discover their source: an immense, partially submerged crystalline structure reflects the strange light of this strange place. Countless flat panels connect at strange angles, creating a vaguely pyramid shape. Near the waterline is a gaping hole large enough to allow passage by the *Ultros*. Jagged edges suggest that this entryway was made by force rather than being an original feature of this odd structure.

This huge crystal structure rises out of the Nether Sea. The **Kraken** was once imprisoned here, but it escaped and now dwells in the Forgotten Sea. A gaping hole near the water line allows access into the interior of the mirror prison. A ship such as the *Ultros* can sail into this hole to the interior of the crystal structure.

The walls and ceiling of the interior are covered in hundreds of square mirrors, each 6 feet to a side. These mirrors reflect whoever enters the prison, and each

![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)

mirror shows a warped version of the viewer. At the rear of the crystal structure's interior is a small island made from broken mirrors. Gold, silver, and gemstones are piled on the island in a large hoard.

#### **The Dragon's Lair**

This island is the lair of an **adult brass dragon** named **Hezzebal**. Hezzebal was the mount of a Dragonlord who explored the Nether Sea five centuries ago, scouting for a location to hide the treasures of the Dragonlords. Hezzebal broke into the Mirror Prison and accidentally released the Kraken in the process. The Kraken sealed the dragon inside the prison and then tormented him by slowly and messily devouring his bonded Dragonlord.

Over centuries, the mirrors warped Hezzebal so that his wings became twisted, and his alignment has changed to evil. Hezzebal now lairs in the broken prison, occasionally going out into the Nether Sea to hunt.

Hezzebal usually lurks beneath the water, having become immune to the effects of the Nether Sea. He will surface to converse with intruders if they start to loot his dragon hoard. He will reveal his history to gain sympathy and will inquire about the party's purpose here.

#### **Epic Paths: The Forgotten Dragon**

If the Vanished One is present, then Hezzebal recognizes them as one of the ancient Dragonlords and blames them for his long imprisonment. He believes that the Dragonlords deliberately left him here—that they only ever saw the dragons as tools to be used and discarded. Refer to the *Running the Epic Paths* section for details.

If the heroes reveal that they are enemies of Lutheria, then he explains that she is a vain creature. She visits the River Lethe with some frequency, in order to water her gardens. He has always kept his distance from her. Eventually, Hezzebal will grow bored of talking and will try to devour the heroes.

*Battling Hezzebal.* Hezzebal cannot fly. He has a swim speed of 80 feet, he is immune to the effects of the Nether Sea, and he has *water breathing*. His madness can be cured with a *greater restoration* spell, but it must be cast three times, and he will interpret it as a hostile action. If his madness is cured, his alignment reverts to good, but he has three permanent levels of exhaustion.

#### **The Mirrors**

Use the table below to randomly determine what someone sees upon looking into a mirror. Once someone has looked into a mirror, it may be removed from the wall and taken away for use elsewhere, but doing so requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Otherwise the mirror will shatter when it is taken down.

If someone looks at one of the mirrors for an entire round, they must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into the form of their reflection. This can be reversed with a *greater restoration* spell.

#### **The Dragon's Hoard**

Brass Dragon

The dragon's hoard consists of 30,000 sp, 5,000 gp, and a single *adamantine ingot*. Additionally, there is a *xiphos of slaughter* hidden beneath the coins. Hezzebal the

#### **Epic Paths: The Dragonlords' Treasure**

If the Lost One is present, then the fabled treasures of the Dragonlords are among the dragon's hoard. Estor will demand to claim one item first, but he will not specify his choice until the party agrees to his demand. He chooses the *xiphos of slaughter*.

The Lost One should choose the items that they want from the list of possible rewards for their epic path. The other items from the list are not present. Refer to the *Running the Epic Paths* section for details.

## **N5. Island of the Oathbreakers**

A small, rocky island rises from the inky black sea. From a distance, its surface appears to be covered by a forest of twisted, leafless trees that begins near the waterline. Closer inspection reveals that the trees are petrified, made from the same dark gray stone as the rest of the island. A great column of the same stone rises high above their tallest branches at the forest's center.

This island is where all oathbreakers from Thylea are brought by Lutheria's **erinyes**. It is a place of punishment for any who break solemnly-sworn oaths, and rightly held to be a terrible place by all mortals.

Many centuries ago, when mortals first began to arrive on the shores of Thylea, Lutheria made a deal with an **ultroloth** from the bleak plane of Hades. This ultroloth became the warden of the prisoners brought to the *Island of the Oathbreakers*. When an erinyes arrives with an oathbreaker, the ultroloth chains the offender to the central column and threatens torture as punishment for attempting to escape.

#### **The Oathbreakers**

The island is surrounded by an entropic field which sustains prisoners, eliminating the need for them to eat or drink, although they are perpetually hungry and thirsty. There are hundreds of mortals still alive on the island and thousands of corpses, some centuries dead. Every one of these prisoners is chained to the central column that rises from the center of the island.

As you approach the center of the island, you are able to make out the thousands of individual chains anchored in the great stone pillar. Held fast by the chains are the skeletal remains of many mortals. Some appear to be centuries old. Although there are some living prisoners, they ignore you. Most of them seem to have had their mouths sewn shut.

The **ultroloth** keeps the prisoners alive until they perish of natural causes. He is served by four **mezzoloths** who watch the prisoners intently and occasionally torment them for their own amusement.

*Lutheria's Punishment.* The vast majority of the prisoners here have had their mouths sewn shut. However, this is not the ultroloth's handiwork. Every year, Lutheria visits the island and tells jokes to the prisoners, making a note of those who do not laugh loudly enough. Then, she personally sews their mouths shut as punishment.

#### **The Wisest Prisoner**

The most helpful prisoner on the island is a woman named Oresteia (NE **mage**). Oresteia is one of very few prisoners who can speak, because she's wise enough to flatter the Lady of Dreams during her annual visits. Oresteia has two pieces of advice for the heroes:

- **•** Always laugh at Lutheria's jokes.
- **•** Challenge Lutheria to the Royal Game.

Oresteia has earned preferential treatment from the Lady of Dreams for decades by following this advice. She keeps the Titan entertained by humoring her jokes and devising surprising new strategies for the Royal Game. Lutheria has even ordered the ultroloth to keep the mage in some measure of comfort, bringing her wine and stale bread from time to time.

Oresteia warns the heroes that Lutheria will always win the *game of twenty squares*, because she's devised some way to cheat. The Titan loves winning almost as much as she hates losing. However, the magic she uses to cheat at the game also seems to drain her energy. The mage has never pushed her luck enough to try and win the game, but it's possible that Lutheria will be more vulnerable after a particularly rousing game.

# **N6. Gargantuan Cubes**

Your vessel sails towards an island that seems strangely square-shaped. It soon becomes clear that the island is actually a gargantuan iron cube. Runes have been deeply etched into each of the faces you can see. The bottom face is level with the surface of the sea; the top face, some hundred feet above, hangs from five massive chains. The chains disappear into the fathomless heavens of the Nether Sea. A disturbing noise echoes from within the structure, alternating between a low rumble and a high whistle.

A huge iron cube, 100 feet on each edge, hangs from five massive chains: four chains attach to the top corners of the cube, and the last attaches to the center of the cube's

top face. The bottom of the cube just touches the water of the Nether Sea. There are runes inscribed into the iron cube, and these can be used as handholds if anyone tries to climb the walls. The top face of the iron cube is flat except for a small entryway in one corner (B1).

The cube that hangs closest to Titan Island (N3) is the only cube that the heroes are able to gain access to. They must have learned the primordial word from the living Titan on that island in order to enter it.

#### **Hanging Prison Cubes**

Hanging from the ceiling of the Nether Sea there are several other cubes that contain other weapons of the gods. These weapons are unfathomably dangerous creatures, just as terrible as a **tarrasque** or **kraken**. These prisons cannot be opened just yet, but they will come into play later. Refer to the *Apokalypsis* chapter for details.

# **Lutheria's Barge**

A movement on the horizon breaks the gloomy monotony of the Nether Sea. A pair of immense shapes come into view: the first is the upper body of a colossal male humanoid wading through the waves. Rags obscure much of his face, but it is clear that his lips have been sealed shut. Scars cover his muscular body as he trudges slowly onward, gripping onto a great length of chain. He pulls a massive, impressive bronze barge. Lush green plants spill over the top of the barge—a verdant garden in a lifeless expanse of black ocean.

This barge is *Hypnos,* the dwelling place of Lutheria. This massive bronze vessel is pulled by **Talieus** (LN **empyrean**), a 200-foot-tall Titan who has been blinded and broken by his malevolent sister. He wades through the Nether Sea, eternally pulling Lutheria's barge.

Lutheria's barge is a hanging garden that features lush plants, vines, and trees. Fantastical flowers grow in the garden, of almost every kind imaginable, and their perfume almost drowns out the acidic smell of the Nether Sea. If the heroes approach Lutheria's barge, refer to the *Hypnos, Throne of Dreams* section.

We know that the Titans possess powers that have yet to be revealed. My mother forced them into a stalemate before they ever became desperate enough to unleash such horrors. But the time may yet come when we learn what was locked away at the dawn of time.

> — Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom

This gargantuan iron cube, 100 feet on each edge, hangs from five massive chains. The center chain has a strange contraption attached to it: an hourglass made from transparent adamantine. About two thirds of the sand inside is in the bottom half of the hourglass, while the rest pours slowly down. Inside the cube is one of the weapons of the gods, a **tarrasque**. There are also **primordial golems** that have existed since the creation of the cube. These undying constructs are there to protect the workings of the cube and make sure that the tarrasque is fed.

#### **History of the Cube**

While Lutheria was originally ordered by her father Kentimane to watch over the weapons of the gods, she has tricked an ancient **ultroloth** to do the work instead. Lutheria deceived the creature by promising him dominion over an eternal kingdom in the Nether Sea. The ultroloth is bound to the cube until Lutheria dies, or until she releases him from his oath.

# **Primordial Golems**

#### Primordial golems are unfinished creatures that the gods left behind to guard their weapons. They look like featureless humanoids and they have the same statistics as **clay golems** except that they are Medium instead of Large-sized. In battle, they will attack the same target until it is dead. Whenever they reduce the hit point maximum of their current target with their *slam* attack, they will take on the appearance of that target.

For example, if their target is a dwarf, then they will grow shorter and stockier after the first hit. Next round, they will grow a beard. A primordial golem will look identical to its chosen target by the time it has reduced the target's hit point maximum by 40 or more.

# **KEY LOCATIONS**

## **B1. Entrance**

At the very top of the gargantuan iron cube, there is a complex contraption like a massive hourglass that stands more than 30 feet tall. Sand empties from the top half of the hourglass into the bottom half, with aching slowness. Drilled into one corner of the cube's surface, there is a circular portal of black metal.

The door at the corner of the iron cube is the entrance. It is a circular hatchway made from adamantine, and it is invulnerable to damage. The only way to open it is

to speak the primordial word of power that was used to create the cube. This word can be learned from the living Titan on *Titan Island* (N3). The *legend lore* spell can also be used to reveal it.

The primordial word is pretty much unpronounceable by mortals. It will appear in a hero's mind, be used once to open the portal, and then vanish. The players don't actually need to know or speak the word. They only need to know that it exists in one hero's mind.

*The Hourglass.* A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that it will take three centuries for all the sand to run into the bottom of the hourglass. This is some sort of timing mechanism. Eventually, the creature imprisoned inside will awaken and return to the surface: this happens once every thousand years.

# **B2. Entry Chamber**

As you descend the spiral staircase and enter the chamber below, you are met by dark, gloomy surroundings. A sense of dread fills the air. You feel a strange presence before noticing two featureless humanoid statues, standing motionless in the corner of the room.

A spiral stair leads down into this room. It is guarded by two **primordial golems**. They will not move to attack until an intruder steps onto the floor of the chamber. They fight until destroyed.

#### **General Features of the Cube**

The inside of the cube is strangely cold and alien.

- **•** The ceilings are 15 ft. high, unless otherwise noted.
- **•** All of the doors are made from iron.
- **•** All of the rooms are unlit.

#### **B3. Chamber of Worms**

The floor of this chamber is filled with huge, writhing worms that wriggle and squirm over each other. The effect is quite disturbing. A narrow bridge crosses to the other side of the room, some five feet above the hideous, writhing worms. A featureless humanoid golem stands guard in the middle of the bridge.

The floor is covered with hundreds of juvenile purple worms. These are the tarrasque's food supply. Each of the purple worms has the statistics of a **giant poisonous snake**. If someone enters the pit, they will be attacked by 2d6 worms each round. The **primordial golem** will try to knock intruders from the bridge into the vat of

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

purple worms. The worms will not attack the primordial golem, because it doesn't appear to be food.

Area damage spells such as *fireball* can kill most (but not all) of the worms. Some worms will always survive, hidden beneath the corpses. No more than 5,000 XP can be earned here from slaughtering the worms.

#### **B4. Breeding Chamber**

This must be some sort of breeding chamber for the worms. Two giant purple colored worms, more than thirty feet in length, are chained and entwined with one another in the center of the room. Featureless humanoid golems work on the worms, paying little attention to anything else in front of them.

This is the breeding chamber for the tarrasque's food. Purple worms breed in a manner similar to earth worms. The two purple worms join together and pass genetic material to one another. This is stored in sacs and then a cocoon forms on the body of each worm, with each cocoon holding 1d6 wormlings. Once these worm-filled cocoons are large enough, they are taken to the *Chamber of Worms* (B3) and emptied. The purple worms here can also be milked for their poison.

The two adult **purple worms** in the room are restrained by adamantine chains. Three **primordial golems** are currently collecting poison from one of the purple worms. They will, however, immediately stop work and attack any intruders. Even while restrained, the purple worms are not completely harmless. Anyone who comes within 10 feet of a worm's head will be the target of a *bite* attack. Anyone who comes within 10 feet of the other end of the worm will be targeted by a *stinger* attack. Treat these as readied actions. Note that the purple worms will not attack the golems.

# **B5. Feeding Chute**

In this room, the walls and floors are covered in a thick, mucous slime that almost seems alive. The floor is marked by strange engravings that look like a grid. On opposite sides of the room are levers on the walls: one lever is shaped like a worm, while the other is hornshaped. A shapeless humanoid figure stands in the chamber next to the worm-shaped lever.

This is where the purple worms are brought before being dumped on the tarrasque as fodder. The wormshaped lever on the wall releases a dozen small purple worms into this room. The other lever, shaped like a horn, opens a trap door in the floor, which dumps the worms into the tarrasque's chamber below.

One **primordial golem** waits in the room. When the party reaches the room, the golem pulls the worm lever to dump a dozen purple wormlings (same statistics as **giant poisonous snakes**) onto the floor. The golem then waits until someone enters the room. At this point, it will move to pull the other lever and open the trap door. Anyone standing on the trap door when it opens must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the tarrasque pit below.

# **B6. Dumping Hall**

This long hall has a strange floor. The floor appears to have dozens of small holes, each with an iron covering. At the far end of the hall, there is a circular metal door with a small lever located beside it.

This strange room is the mechanism for waking the tarrasque. When the tarrasque needs to be awakened, a primordial golem opens the circular door. When the circular door is opened, the entrance door slams shut and locks. This causes the hall to fill with purple worm venom in three rounds. The circular door automatically closes and locks after three rounds. All of the locks require a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open. The lever beside the door can be used to open up the small holes in the floor. The poison drains through the holes onto the tarrasque below and awakens the gargantuan beast.

Anyone in the room when it is filling with poison will take 1d6 poison damage per round. Anyone who drinks or breathes in the poison (for example, with *water breathing*) takes the full damage from *purple worm poison* (12d6). Anyone with fewer than 75% of their hit points remaining takes full damage from the second round onwards, as the poison seeps into their wounds.

# **B7. Poison Chamber**

This is where the purple worm poison is kept until it is needed. The *Dumping Hall* (B6) describes the effects of being immersed in the poison.

# **B8. Chamber of the Guardian**

This chamber is dominated by an unearthly table with several goblets on it, each filled with a purple liquid. Sitting at the table is a faceless humanoid dressed in a flowing cloak, and beside him are three bronze constructs that are designed with his likeness. The humanoid has a strange-looking talisman around its neck.

This room is where the caretaker of the prison, an **ultroloth**, can be found. Initially, he will not be hostile to the heroes. Instead, one of his **bronze automatons** will be used as a mouthpiece to communicate with the heroes. The ultroloth is intelligent, and he understands why the heroes have broken into the prison. He seeks to be released from his bargain with Lutheria, so he is very open about his desire to assist the heroes.

He is willing to tell the heroes how to awaken the tarrasque but, in return, they must swear an oath to kill Lutheria and bring her crystal scythe back to him. This oath is a serious matter, and it will be enforced by the erinyes of the *Island of the Oathbreakers*. If the heroes are unwilling to swear the oath, then the ultroloth expresses his profound disappointment in them. He attacks with the help of his three **bronze automatons**.

The strange goblets are filled with *purple worm poison*. The ultroloth has acquired a taste for the substance, and he is resistant to its effects. He won't stop anyone from trying a drink for themselves, because he would find it amusing to watch. The bronze automatons are Sydon's gifts to him; the Titan wished to curry favor with the ultroloth in case he ever needed to use one of the weapons of the gods.

#### **Treasure**

The ultroloth wears a *talisman of the sphere* around his neck. He uses this to control the *sphere of annihilation* in the *Chamber of Execution* (B11).

# **B9. Golem Storage**

Featureless humanoid golems stand silent and still in a sad crowd at the center of this room. There are a dozen of them. Some have missing arms, while a couple have missing heads.

This is where damaged golems are repaired by the ultroloth. None of them are operational, but the heroes don't need to be told that they are broken. As far as the party is concerned, the golems are merely unresponsive.

### **B10. Locking Chamber**

This room is colder than the rest of the complex. There are four huge floating spheres marked by ancient runes. The walls are also covered in the same runes.

The tarrasque can only be released from this room. Each of the floating spheres has an ancient legend about the tarrasque inscribed on it in the Primordial tongue. All the stories are terrifying to anyone who can read them.

To open the cube, someone wearing the ultroloth's *talisman of the sphere* (B8) must control the *sphere of annihilation* (B11) so that it sits at the very center of the room. The wearer of the talisman must then read aloud the texts from each sphere. This causes them to spin. Once all of the spheres are spinning, the bottom of the cube will open, hundreds of feet below. The tarrasque will be dumped into the Nether Sea, and the ancient beast will then make its way to the surface of Thylea and begin to wreak untold damage.

#### **Releasing the Tarrasque**

Releasing the tarrasque at this point in the adventure is very unlikely. The ultroloth is the only creature who knows the proper ritual, and he is unwilling to share this secret.

Lutheria despised her role as caretaker of the iron cubes. I think she took pity on the creatures locked within. Perhaps one day she will release them.

— Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria

## **B11. Chamber of Execution**

A large, two-foot wide black sphere floats at the very center of this room. The sphere seems to absorb light.

The sphere at the center of the room is a *sphere of annihilation*. The sphere is part of the ritual required to open the *Locking Chamber* (B10) and release the tarrasque.

*Killing the Tarrasque.* The sphere also allows the ultroloth to kill the tarrasque if needed. The ultroloth must move the sphere to the top of the sleeping tarrasque's head and then send it through the creature's brain. If the tarrasque is awake, this form of execution is no longer possible, as the tarrasque will simply dodge out of the way of the sphere.

#### **B12. The Pit**

A large pit looks down into a vast chamber that makes up most of the iron cube's interior. Inside, a gargantuan nightmarish creature slumbers. A thick, spiny brown carapace covers the back of the immense reptile, which resembles a predatory lizard with clawed forelimbs slightly smaller than its legs. If the monster has eyes, they are not clearly visible from your current position.

The **tarrasque** will remain sleeping unless it takes damage or it is fed with purple worms. If awakened, it will attack and attempt to consume anything in its pit.

If there is nothing to eat when it awakens, then the tarrasque will angrily smash itself against the walls of its prison. The resulting noise echoes across the entire Nether Sea and attracts the attention of Lutheria. In this case, she will sail to investigate the prison in her throne ship, *Hypnos*. Only after 24 hours of angry activity will the tarrasque grow tired of battering itself against the walls of its prison and return to its slumber.

# **Hypnos, Throne of Dreams**

*Hypnos* is the domain of Lutheria, who is called the Lady of Dreams and the Mistress of Death. Her throne ship is a massive bronze ceremonial floating palace that is pulled across the Nether Sea by her ancient sibling, **Talieus** (LN **empyrean**). The enslaved Titan has been blinded and his mouth has been sewn shut. The only clean parts of his face are where tears have trickled down from his ruined eye sockets. He now trudges on, without rest or thanks, through the Nether Sea.

Lutheria's barge is a hanging garden that features lush plants, vines, and trees. Fantastical flowers grow in the garden, of almost every kind imaginable, and their

perfume almost drowns out the acidic smell of the Nether Sea. Lutheria spends much of her time in her garden.

Beneath the garden is a network of tunnels and rooms inhabited by Lutheria's servants. These spaces are lined with tens of thousands of mortal skulls. Lutheria's servants include **lamias**. These half-woman/half-lion monstrosities are maenads that Lutheria has twisted into a more powerful form. The lamias are served by **jackalwere**, who were once male priests of Lutheria. Their loyalty has been rewarded by being summoned to the Lady's garden, where they are transformed into creatures who can serve her better.

#### **The Throne of Dreams**

Events in *Hypnos* should have an otherworldly and dream-like quality. Ideally, the heroes should feel a kind of unease and distrust of everything that they experience in *Hypnos*. They should never be quite sure whether they are awake or in some sort of lucid dream or nightmare.

Things in Lutheria's domain are not always quite what they seem. Her servants may behave in irrational, dreamlike ways. Distances between parts of the vessel need not always be consistent. For example, walking across the ship's deck may seem like an endless journey of days through a densely overgrown jungle.

# **General Features**

- **•** The ceilings are 15 ft. high unless otherwise noted.
- **•** The doors are wooden unless otherwise noted.
- **•** All of the rooms are lit by a permanent *light* spell.

# **KEY LOCATIONS**

**H1. Dreamer's Dock**

You notice a small platform jutting from the side of the bronze barge, just above the waterline. The structure appears to be used as a dock, and may be out of view from the main deck. Behind the platform is the very faint outline of what might be a door into the vessel.

The opening mechanism for the secret entrance can be detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Behind the door is a small chamber. This is the lair of a **lamia** and five **jackalwere**. They are lounging in the small boats that float in the water of the chamber.

The lamia has used *disguise self,* and she looks like a beautiful woman. The lamia will greet intruders by kissing their hands. Anyone who allows this to happen comes under the lamia's *curse,* and for the next hour, they will have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

The jackalwere are *polymorphed* into beautiful men and women, and are currently smoking pipes of *black lotus*. They invite anyone who enters the room to join them for a smoke. The jackalwere will try to wait until a majority of intruders have been cursed by the lamia. At this point, they will use their *sleep gaze* and claim that the party is drowsy from the effects of the lotus.

The jackalwere and lamia will defend themselves if attacked. If they are able to put the entire party to sleep, then they take them to *The Kitchens* (H8).

# **H2. Dreamer's Halls**

Underneath the lush greenery of the ship's deck, you find yourselves in a series of long, dark hallways. The walls and floor are lined with countless humanoid skulls. The skulls stare at you with dead eyes.

The halls are empty. Whenever the heroes move between rooms, the skulls appear to silently laugh at them. Traversing the halls seems to take much longer than the distances on the map would suggest. Each minute spent in the hallways feels like hours.

# **H3. The Erinyes**

This room is lavishly appointed. Each individual piece of decor is breathtaking in its artistry, and the styles are so varied that they combine to create an overall impression of discordant opulence. Two women with red-feathered wings are in the room. One polishes a suit of heavy black armor while the other examines the bowstring of a great longbow.

This is the home of the erinyes who are sent out to capture oathbreakers in Thylea. There are usually two **erinyes** here at any time, waiting to be called upon. They are not hostile, but they will defend themselves. The room has furniture from many worlds and times.

*Treasure.* The furnishings of this room are worth about 10,000 gp in total, but attempting to remove even a single piece will provoke the ire of the erinyes.

## **H4. Hall of Trinkets**

A doorway opens into a wide room lined with tall marble plinths, each displaying a unique object. Although many of the items are beautiful and unusual, some appear quite mundane. The nearest item is a writing quill with a brilliant orange plume that smolders like an ember. The next plinth supports a bright, silver-colored mask, depicting the face of an elven woman of unparalleled beauty.

Two small girls tend to this odd collection. One dusts an ivory box while the other polishes a simple platinum coin. The two girls possess unnaturally symmetrical features. They move with a feline grace.

This gallery hall is where Lutheria stores some of the magical trinkets that she has collected over the ages. She doesn't collect items for their power or utility, but rather because the items amuse her. All of the items rest on marble plinths:

- **•** *A carved ivory music box.* When this is opened, a small turntable begins to move and the sounds of wailing and screaming fill the air. The box holds the souls of thousands of people from another world. Their rulers made a pact with Powers from the Nine Hells that their nation would rule the world for a thousand years. Aftewards, all the native souls would be the property of an archdevil. When the thousand years ended, the nation's most powerful wizards tried to protect the souls by binding them within the box, and the souls have remained there for millennia, without physical form and driven to madness.
- **•** *An apple-sized dodecahedron* forged from adamantine with strange, unreadable runes inscribed upon it. This is the only remaining object from a world that was swallowed by its sun.
- **•** *A mithral mask* of a beautiful elven woman. The wearer sees everything in the world in the most beautiful way imaginable, regardless of its reality.
- **•** *A platinum coin* with the head of a dragon stamped on one side and a dragon's tail on the other. The coin doesn't radiate any magical aura, but it can be attuned. Once attuned, the coin will always land on the face that its owner wishes when it is flipped.

**•** *A phoenix-feather writing quill.* The quill was used to write the *Codex of the Infinite Planes*. Anyone writing with this quill always produces beautiful handwriting, and the writer can write in any language, even languages they cannot speak or understand.

Two **lamias** guard this room, but they appear to be young girls, and they claim to be sisters. They introduce trespassers to their "toys," happily describing each item to those who are curious. They drag visitors to each plinth excitedly, but they warn against touching anything, because it makes Lutheria mad.

The lamia try to touch as many heroes as possible, holding their hands and pulling them around like excited children. Anyone who is touched by the lamia is affected by their *intoxicating touch* for 1 hour.

If any of the items are touched or taken, the two girls will begin to shriek. Any **jackalwere** below deck will come running and attack the intruders. When this happens, the lamia revert to their true forms and attack.

# **H5. Room of Nightmares**

Although similar in size to most of the ship's other chambers, the emptiness of this room makes it appear much larger. There is a beautiful golden chair at the center of the room. You have a feeling that sitting in this chair will make your wildest dreams come true.

This room is used to break prisoners by bringing their worst nightmares to life. Anyone sitting in the chair activates the room's magic. The door vanishes and the person in the chair becomes incapacitated for one minute. During that time, a nightmare becomes manifest. The only way to stop the manifestation is to reduce the dreamer's hit points to zero.

Roll on the *Table of Nightmares*, or have the player whose character is in the chair choose which nightmare is the worst from the list below. Do not tell them the consequences before they make the choice.

# **H6. Hall of Armaments**

This room appears to be an armory. It is guarded by four wild-eyed men who ignore your arrival, muttering incomprehensibly to themselves. Four items hang from skeletal hands that emerge from the walls: a greataxe, a greatsword, a shield, and a set of plate armor.

Four **jackalwere** guard this room, disguised as gibbering madmen. They leave intruders alone unless someone touches the weapons or armor on display. Whenever an item is touched, the jackalwere grow

#### **Table of Nightmares**

#### **d10 Result**

- 1–2 **Nightmare of a shrinking room.** The room begins to shrink, and after five rounds, the room is so small that it crushes everyone inside. Each creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per round for every other creature in the room. For example: if there are five creature in the room, then each creature takes 4d6 damage per round.
- 3–4 **Nightmare of falling.** The room and chair vanish, and everyone inside the room begins to fall. After 10 rounds they hit the room's floor for 20d6 bludgeoning damage, and the nightmare ends.
- 5–6 **Nightmare of being naked.** At the end of every round, a non-magical item vanishes from each hero. At the end of 10 rounds, all remaining non-magical items vanish forever. If the nightmare ends early, then all of the vanished items return.
- 7–8 **Nightmare of teeth falling out.** At the end of every round, a tooth falls from the mouth of the dreamer. Each tooth instantly transforms into a monster that attacks and tries to eat the party. The tooth-monsters appear in this order:

1. Skeleton, 2. Griffon, 3. Minotaur, 4. Gorgon, 5. Mezzoloth, 6. Salamander, 7. Cyclops, 8. Chimera, 9. Grick Alpha, 10. Nycaloth

9–10 **Nightmare of drowning.** Blood gushes from the mouth of the dreamer and fills the room in two rounds. Use the *drowning* rules. *Water breathing* does not work, because the liquid is blood.

quiet and stare at whoever touched it, using *sleep gaze* to render the offender unconscious. Anyone who has been touched by a lamia will have disadvantage on their saving throw.

#### **Weapons of Madness**

The weapons and armor displayed in this room contain portions of Lutheria's ancient madness. Sydon once attempted to cure his sister's insanity by drawing it out like a poison. He forged this psychic energy into the magic items in this room. They are: *plate mail of vulnerability*, *berserker greataxe*, *shield of missile attraction*, and a *greatsword of vengeance*.

Anyone touching one of these cursed items for the first time must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or contract a short-term madness (see *Madness* in the 5th Edition *Game Master's Guide*). Heroes that succeed on this saving throw are immune to the effects from that point forward.

*Using the Weapons.* Lutheria has disadvantage on attack rolls versus characters who are wielding one of these items. If an attack from one of these weapons hits Lutheria, or if she hits someone wearing the armor with her scythe, then the cursed item is destroyed, and

**Chapter 7 | The Nether Sea**

she is immediately overwhelmed by the ancient madness that was bound within the item. Whenever this happens, Lutheria suffers the effects of the *confusion* spell until the end of her next turn.

### **H7. Scrying Room**

Two strange women sit in this room, with their backs to the door. Both women have the lower bodies of lions. Each of these creatures stares intently into a looking glass. The mirrors display apparently random scenes from all over Thylea. The images flicker through too quickly for you to take in specific details.

The women are two **lamias**. They use the mirrors to watch all the lands of Thylea, and they make daily reports to Lutheria. They are proud of this task, and they are happy to explain it to the heroes.

The lamias attempt to touch the heroes during their explanation. They may try to show the heroes something disturbing, such as King Acastus plotting against them—or the massive fleet that Sydon has gathered. Once they have touched the heroes, the lamias summon all the remaining **jackalwere** on this deck and attack the party.

Each of the mirrors is attuned to a lamia, and they will not work when anyone else attempts to use them.

# **H8. The Kitchens**

Several scrawny dog-like men scurry about this kitchen, preparing sumptuous foods. They are ordered around by a monstrous woman with the lower body of a lion. You can smell something delicious cooking, but many of the meat dishes include shanks of suspiciously humanoid body parts.

This is where feasts are prepared for Lutheria and her guests. A single **lamia** supervises the work of three **jackalwere**. None of them have the time to disguise their true forms, as they are always busy preparing the next meal. When meals are ready, they are taken up to *Lutheria's Garden* (H10) and served.

*Captured Heroes.* Heroes who have been captured by the jackalwere's *sleep* ability will awaken here, trussed up and ready for the oven. Spellcasters will have an apple shoved into their mouths.

# **H9. Sleeping Chamber**

This chamber is dimly lit by a single torch. There are five beds here, each occupied by a sleeping form.

This chamber is where Lutheria's servants sleep. Two male **dryads** and three female **satyrs** are asleep here. They are consorts to the jackalwere. If awakened, they will be frightened, but they will not fight.

# **H10. Lutheria's Garden**

This entire vessel is covered with lush greenery that obscures details of its deck and hides any crew who might be on board. This strange garden's vibrant colors stand out in stark contrast against the murky grays of the Nether Sea. A chaotic mix of scents pleasant, revolting, and exotic—drift from the abundant flora.

This garden is full of exotic plants from all over the multiverse, and Lutheria has carefully chosen ones that are beautiful, produce intoxicating scents, or that bear fruits that can be used for wines or narcotics. Many of these plants seem revolting to the eyes and to the nose, but Lutheria's sensibilities and tastes are unlike those of common mortals.

Any hero who eats fruit or deliberately takes in the flowers' scents may be overcome in some way, as shown on the table opposite.

#### **The Lady of Dreams**

When Lutheria is not traveling the world and meddling in the affairs of mortals, she spends her time here, sitting on the throne in her garden. To entertain herself, she throws bacchanals—parties of drunken

excess—for her most devoted servants. Lutheria does not immediately attack those who trespass in her garden. She will first satisfy her curiosity and seek to entertain herself by telling jokes, playing games, and toying with her prey.

# **Confronting Lutheria**

Read the following when the heroes meet Lutheria:

This courtyard is filled with goatlings and fey creatures engaged in drunken revelry. At the center of the crowd, a beautiful giant-sized woman lounges on an ornate throne. Most of the revelers are so intoxicated that they fail to notice your presence, but the black-eyed woman immediately locks eyes with you.

"Ah, the heroes of the prophecy. I suppose you have come to kill me. That would be *very* boring. Wouldn't you prefer to join the festivities?"

Despite the cup of wine in her hand, the woman's voice remains sober, but her eyes brim with madness.

There are many ways that the encounter with Lutheria can play out, depending upon the actions of the heroes.

#### **The Bacchanal**

The garden is filled with Lutheria's servants, all of whom are engaged in debauchery and drunken revelry. The participants include two **lamias**, two **satyr minstrels**, and seven **goatlings**. All but Lutheria are drunk (they have the poisoned condition).

Lutheria's servants urge the heroes to join in the revelry, forcing drinks into their hands and trying to entice

them with sensual words. But joining the revelry is, in effect, a death sentence by poisoning.

Heroes who drink the wine must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or else they become poisoned and abandon their senses. While participating in the revelry, they take 1d6 psychic damage each round. In order to regain control of themselves, the heroes must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.

Refusing to join in has no immediate consequences. Lutheria turns a withering gaze upon each person in the heroes' party, then tosses back her drink and ignores them. Your players should feel uneasy about their refusal to join—it's not wise to spoil Lutheria's fun.

Attacking Lutheria will cause all her servants to abandon their revelry and rush to her defense, even though they are drunk and effectively poisoned.

# **Lutheria's Joke**

Lutheria is unwilling to discuss anything until she's had a chance to test the heroes.

"Wait—before we discuss *business*, allow me to break the ice. Although you are shameless trespassers, I feel *obligated* to entertain you."

Lutheria deadpans the following jokes. With each joke, the entire entourage bursts into a chorus of laughter. Lutheria does not laugh. She watches the heroes intently, gauging their reaction.

- **• What is the most disgusting thing imaginable?** › *A bag full of dead mortal children.*
- **• And what is more disgusting than that?** › *One at the bottom is still wriggling.*
- **• What's the difference between an onion and an innocent mortal child?**

› *I cry when I chop up an onion.*

It should be clear to your players that they are actually expected to laugh out loud at these jokes. If anyone refuses to laugh, Lutheria becomes irate. She points at each hero who failed to laugh and berates them.

Lutheria's points at you accusingly, and her eyes burn into the back of your skull. "You there. Why didn't you laugh? Are you bored? Am I *boring* to you? Answer me!"

On the other hand, if the heroes humor Lutheria by laughing at her jokes, then she applauds their sense of humor. This puts her in a better mood to bargain.

# **The Royal Game**

The heroes may challenge Lutheria to the *game of twenty squares*. Lutheria loves the game, but she rarely gets to play it, because she has a habit of killing anyone who beats her at it.

Lutheria's eyes light up, and she makes a gesture with her hand. The deck in front of her throne shimmers and becomes a board of twenty black-and-white squares.

"It has been *much* too long since someone has had the courage to challenge me to the Royal Game! But what shall we wager? Oh, I know!"

With another wave of her hand, Lutheria summons seven goatlings to stand in the board's starting row. Then she waves her hand again, and seven of your comrades from the *Ultros* appear opposite them. They stand completely still, as if paralyzed.

"We shall wager the lives of our servants." The goddess grins and strokes her crystal scythe.

Before the game begins, three winged forms set down on the deck to watch the game. These are the Furies from the *Room of Far Sight* (S33). They have come to enforce the rules of the game and prevent anyone from backing out prematurely. This annoys Lutheria, but she has no choice but to accept it. If the players become hostile or uncooperative, the Furies summon seven **erinyes** for backup and banish the heroes to the *Island of the Oathbreakers* (N5).

*Playing the Game.* Refer to the *game of twenty squares* entry in the *Treasures* appendix for details about the rules of the game. Lutheria uses an ancient rule that has been forgotten by mortals: since the heroes challenged her to the game, she has the right to determine the wager. The Furies agree to this.

*Lutheria's Strategy.* Lutheria loves the game almost as much as she hates losing. Over the centuries, she has devised a way of cheating without detection. When she fails one of the opposed skill rolls, she may spend one of her uses of *legendary resistance* to automatically win the roll instead. All of Lutheria's rolls should be hidden behind the GM screen. Heroes with high passive Perception scores may notice her cheating, but the Furies are incapable of detecting it.

Lutheria is unsportsmanlike during the game. She gloats when she wins a round and sulks when she loses. She becomes increasingly agitated when she's losing. She may go so far as to expend all three uses of *legendary resistance* in order to ensure her own victory.

*Lutheria Loses.* If the heroes win the match, then Lutheria loses her temper. She slaughters all seven of the goatlings that served as her pieces. The goddess is now in a terrible mood and may attack unprovoked.

*Lutheria Wins.* If the heroes lose the match, then Lutheria is absolutely delighted. She slaughters all seven of the *Ultros* crew that served as their pieces. The Furies ensure that the wager is honored before departing. The goddess is now in an excellent mood and is willing to grant each of the heroes a boon.

#### **Renewing the Oath**

If the heroes ask Lutheria to renew her commitment to the Oath of Peace, then she will agree to do so under one condition: the entire party must swear an indefinite *oath of service* to her. The heroes would be required to do essentially anything she asks for the rest of their lives, as if under the effects of an unbreakable *geas* spell.

*Terms of the Oath.* Lutheria agrees not to harm any of the mortal cities of Thylea. Her temples would remain standing, and she would still require sacrifices, but things would continue much as they have been.

Lutheria has no interest in her husband's schemes. The heroes would still be free to assail Praxys and battle Sydon or negotiate with him separately. She will not interfere with these tasks. She agrees not to demand anything of the players until after they have dealt with her husband (after the *Battle of Mytros*).

#### **Attacking Lutheria**

If the heroes provoke a battle with Lutheria, whether by attacking her or by annoying her too much, read the following:

"You mortals always disappoint me."

The Lady of Dreams appears affected by a deep sadness. Black tears roll down her face. The garden wilts, and all of her servants begin to weep and wail. Minutes pass, and the mournful scene continues. You feel a chill run down your spine.

Finally, Lutheria ostentatiously dries her eyes. Her face breaks into a wicked smile. "Well. I need some cheering up. Let's start by tearing your pathetic little bodies apart, limb from limb."

The heroes are immediately attacked by all of the creatures participating in the bacchanal. Lutheria joins the battle after one round, gleefully inflicting as much damage as she can with her scythe. She loudly orders her minions to torture and crucify the heroes.

This battle should be very difficult, and it should force the heroes to expend all of their resources. You might need to bring in reinforcements from elsewhere in *Hypnos* in order to increase the challenge. You may also choose to have Lutheria summon undead servants, such as **wights** and **ghosts**, to assist in the battle.

#### **Epic Paths: Confronting Lutheria**

If the Doomed One is present, Lutheria spends the first round in combat laughing uncontrollably at the lifetime of misfortune that she inflicted on them. If the Haunted One is present, Lutheria realizes that she's made a mistake and concentrates all her efforts on killing them.

The Haunted One needs to destroy Lutheria's scythe in order to release the souls of their lost family. Refer to the *Running the Epic Paths* section for details.

#### **Defeating Lutheria**

If the heroes fight and defeat Lutheria read the following: 

Lutheria collapses to her knees, grasping at the air in front of you. She unleashes a screeching wail of anguish, refusing to believe that a band of mere mortals has defeated her. Her body slowly transforms into a strange, twisting light. The light explodes into a storm of cosmic matter—and then she vanishes.
