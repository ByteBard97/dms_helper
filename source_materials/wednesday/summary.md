Odyssey of the Dragonlords: A Hero's Journey
This is a summary of our epic adventure in Thylea, chronicling our journey from humble beginnings to the precipice of war.

The Call to Destiny (Sessions 1-5: The Boar, the Oracle, Estoria, and the Mines)

Our tale began in the unassuming Sour Vintage tavern, where we, a disparate group of heroes – Alastor the rogue, Raph the fey magic user, Xenophon the Aresian monk, Nakor the half-elf bard, and Thanakos the human blacksmith – were recruited by the mysterious Kyrah to hunt a giant boar. This seemingly simple task quickly plunged us into the heart of a prophecy when the dying boar delivered a dire warning about an ancient power and the impending doom of Mytros.

Our path led us to the Oracle, where we faced monstrous mimics and a treacherous sea hag, ultimately rescuing Versi, who revealed fragmented visions of our individual epic destinies. Armed with cryptic clues and a sense of purpose, we traveled to Estoria. There, Raph discovered a potential familial connection to King Pythor, and we navigated the political tension surrounding the impending sacrifice of Princess Anora to Sydon. We uncovered the theft of the sacred Horn of Balmytria, tracing it to the corrupted Temple of Demetria, where we faced monstrous creatures and the horrifying truth of the goddess's pact with Lutheria. We narrowly survived a brutal encounter with Demetria and her monstrous allies, gaining a magical ring tied to Xenophon's lost wife.

After a tense negotiation, we convinced Commander Gaius to accept us as substitutes for the sacrifice. Surviving the night chained to the Rock of Estor, we earned the moniker "Day of the Shattered Stone" and gained Pythor's magical hammer. Our fame began to grow, and we learned more about the brewing hurricane near Mytros and King Acastus's efforts to revive the Dragonlords. Our journey then took us to the Mithril Mines, cursed by Lytheria. Battling troglodytes and death dogs, we rescued captured centaurs and discovered the forge of Vulkan. Nakor commissioned a Staff of Healing, and Thanakos gained a Headband of Intellect. A brutal fight with Cerberus left its spirit bound to Raph's spellbook.

Seeking Answers and Allies (Sessions 6-13: The Necropolis, Mytros, and the Ultros)

Guided by Kyrah, we ventured to the Necropolis of Telemok, the resting place of ancient Dragonlords. We encountered Damon the Lich, guardian of the Necropolis, who offered Nakor a potential future as his successor. We explored the tombs, battling undead guardians and uncovering artifacts tied to the Dragonlords and their history, including the disturbing tale of Estor Arkelander's cruelty. Thanakos had a terrifying encounter with Sydon himself. We recovered powerful gear, including Xander's spear and crowns, and learned of the "Lotus Witch" and the location of the ghost ship Ultros.

Arriving in Mytros amidst a magical hurricane conjured by Sydon, we rode in on the backs of dragons provided by King Acastus. We learned of Sydon's demands and the political instability in the city. Choosing to confront Sydon directly, we aided the gods in a ritual to dispel the storm, gaining further fame and earning the unofficial holiday "PARTY GRAS." King Acastus, while seemingly supportive, revealed his own agenda to rebuild the Dragonlords order and gifted us a map to the Ultros, though Valis warned of his true motives. We explored Mytros, gathering supplies and information, learning about the strange nature of Acastus's dragons and the locations of key shops and factions. We located the Ultros at the Dead Falls, a portal to the underworld. Boarding the spectral ship, we faced the undead spirit of Estor Arkelander, defeating him to claim control of the vessel. The Ultros became our mobile base, allowing us to navigate the seas of Thylea. We learned of the Antikythera, a device crucial for charting safe paths, and its missing gear, likely stolen by Gaius. Versi tasked Alastor with finding a dragon egg under the "Prisoner" constellation and subtly hinted at the location of his daughter, Naomi.

Trials, Titans, and Transformations (Sessions 14-31: Islands of Fire, Themis, Scorpion, Fates, Yonder, Time, and the Nether Sea)

Our voyages took us across the constellations of Thylea. On Fire Island ("Prisoner"), we faced the Fire Walker Lizardfolk and their leader, Jancor, who was empowered by Sydon. We battled a fire salamander and discovered dragon eggs within the volcano. We swore an oath to the trapped Titan Chelsia, gaining her favor. We recruited Steros, a skilled Jancan cyclops craftsman, and acquired a bronze dragon egg, which hatched into Doros.

On the Island of Themis ("Twins"), we encountered the militant Amazons and their basilisk hounds. We navigated their treacherous prison, battling animated statues and a multi-headed serpent monster. We rescued Queen Darian, the rightful Amazonian ruler, who had been imprisoned by Lutheria-influenced usurpers. We confronted and defeated Medusa-like creatures serving the false queens, gaining insights into Lutheria's influence and acquiring a magical, albeit dangerous, Hat of Brilliance for Xenophon. We also found Vront, Steros's son, imprisoned by the Amazons.

On Scorpion Island ("Centaur"), we found the Centaurs cursed to turn into scorpions by the Lotus Witch, a Sphinx residing in a time-distorted tower. We navigated the tower's strange temporal effects and answered the Sphinx's riddles, gaining valuable information about the location of "Yonder" (Gaius's hideout) and the Fates. We bonded with Ness, a centaur leader, aiding her tribe.

On the Island of the Fates ("Bard"), we met the three ancient Hags who offered knowledge and power in exchange for steep personal sacrifices. Xenophon traded vitality, Thanakos traded courage (gaining disadvantage on fear saves), and Nakor traded his fertility for a powerful Tome of Leadership and Influence. Raph made a secret deal with the Fates to learn the location of Hexia, the green dragon who had captured his mother.

We then sailed to the island of "Yonder" ("Gygan"), Gaius's fortress. We infiltrated the stronghold, battling soldiers and monstrous guardians. We confronted Gaius, who held Alastor's daughter, Naomi, hostage. A desperate fight ensued, resulting in Naomi's rescue but also her immediate, magically influenced attack on Alastor. We defeated Gaius and recovered the missing gear for the Antikythera. Naomi was eventually healed, revealing intelligence about Lutheria's acolytes and the growing animosity between Sydon and Lutheria's followers.

Our journey continued to the Garden of Helios ("Chariot"), where we met Helios, the God of the Sun, who revealed himself to be a Gold Dragon bound by an oath to Sydon to eliminate us. We faced and defeated Helios in a challenging battle, gaining immense treasure and Raph acquired the powerful Staff of the Magi. We learned more about Hexia's island and the Leviathan that lurks nearby.

On the Island of the Dragon, we ventured into Hexia's jungle lair, learning she was Kyrah's adopted sister and had a complicated history with Pythor. We battled and defeated the ancient green dragon Hexia, rescuing Raph's mother, Daphne, and Versi, who had been captured. Daphne provided crucial information about Sydon's lair (Praxys), the whirlpool to the Nether Sea (Lutheria's domain), the Island of Time, and the Island of Typhon.

We traveled to the Island of Time ("Spear"), encountering a benevolent Time Sphinx who opposed the Titans and offered us trials. We navigated the Time Chamber, a hyperbolic time chamber where we trained for 10 months, emerging significantly more powerful.

Finally, we sailed through a giant waterfall into the acidic Nether Sea, Lutheria's domain. Navigating the corrosive waters with Nakor's repairs, we explored this strange plane. We discovered a giant hourglass and learned about Goleron, a trapped Titan, and the history of this plane's creation by Thylea and Kentimane. We learned about Lutheria's crystal weapons, her penchant for playing the game of 20 squares (which weakens her when she cheats), and her manipulation of other Titans and creation of new races.

The Climax Approaches (Sessions 32-34: Confrontation and Preparation)

Session 32: Our plan to infiltrate Lutheria's barge via the Ethereal Plane was thwarted when she pulled us into her domain. A fierce battle erupted. Nakor's Mass Suggestion sent minions away for loot, while Lutheria focused her attacks on Nakor and Raph. Thanakos delivered a decisive blow, seemingly defeating Lutheria.

Session 33: Lutheria vanished, leaving behind a crystal scythe containing the trapped spirits of Xenophon's family, including the forgotten queen of Aresia. The scythe held immense power but came with negative consequences. The minions returned with "cursed" weapons that had affected Lutheria. We encountered strange toys and the formidable Erinyes, gaining little information about the Oath of Peace. Investigating prison cubes in the Nether Sea, we discovered powerful, trapped beings, including a mad god, and released some back to their home planes.

Session 34: Our investigation of the Nether Sea cubes continued, leading to the escape of an Ultroloth guard. We realized the Oath of Peace was ending in just 4 days, and Sydon's invasion of Mytros was imminent. With time critical, we chose Aresia as our final stop before the main battle. We split the party: Xenophon, Thanakos, and Pythor went to Aresia; Nakor went to recruit Damon the Lich; Alastor sailed to recruit the Amazons; and Pythor coordinated with Estoria. We relayed intel to Mytros, learning of King Acastus's hesitant preparations. Nakor successfully recruited Damon by swearing an Oath of Service. In Aresia, Xenophon was recognized as King and rallied the Aresian army with Queen Helen's support. We received powerful divine gifts: Potions of Healing and Heroism, the Oathbow +2, the Caduceus, and Ambrosia. The night before the battle, we had a dinner with Kyra and Valis, where Nakor used Mass Suggestion on King Acastus to ensure his full commitment to Mytros's defense. Citizens showed overwhelming support, granting us Inspiration. We made final preparations, distributing potions, gaining temporary HP from oranges and an Aid spell. At dawn, the gods revealed their true forms as Bronze Dragons and shared a divine spark with Doros. We bonded with the dragons, gaining their resistances and senses (except Nakor, who would ride with Damon on Pegasus). As Sydon's fleet appeared, a gargantuan Silver Dragon, Icarus (King Acastus's dragon), attacked Mytros. We confronted Icarus, learning he was driven mad by Acastus's aging potions and pressure. Damon successfully dominated Icarus using Dominate Monster and Nakor's Silvery Barbs, ending the immediate threat and gaining a powerful, albeit unstable, ally. We took a short rest and planned to use the dominated Icarus as a battering ram against Sydon's fleet.

The stage is now set for the epic Battle of Mytros, with our heroes and their newly found allies poised to face the full might of Sydon's invasion.
