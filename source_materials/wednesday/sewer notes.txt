D&D Sewer Map Description - Upper Right Quadrant
This document details the areas and connections within the Upper Right quadrant of the sewer map.
Area Descriptions and Connections
Based on the provided map image and notes:
UR1:
            * Description: A circular chamber in the far eastern part of the area. The walls are rough, dark stone. It has a central raised circular platform made of lighter-colored stone, with a structure on top that appears to be a glowing brazier or light source emitting orange light. Surrounding the raised platform is what looks like a stone floor or walkway. Around the perimeter of the chamber, bordering areas of murky green sewer water, are roughly constructed wooden structures or platforms.
            * Connections: Connects to an unnumbered tunnel leading to the west.
UR2:
            * Description: Located in the north-eastern section, this is a roughly circular cave room with rough, dark stone walls and an uneven floor covered in debris and rubble. Four simple, dark metal cages with barred sides and tops are positioned around the perimeter of this room.
            * Connections: Connects to UR4 (South-West) via a tunnel.
UR3:
            * Description: Situated south-east of UR4, this appears to be an open area or chamber within the rough-hewn cave system. It contains several large, oval-shaped eggs with a leathery texture, similar to bird or reptile eggs, nestled in rough nests on the ground. There is a central glowing firepit emitting orange light, providing warmth and illumination to the room.
            * Connections: Connects to UR4 (North-West) via a tunnel and potentially to unnumbered areas to its south and east via tunnels.
UR4:
            * Description: This significant area in the northern part of the quadrant contains a large, dark, irregular opening in the ground (the pit) with rough, rocky edges that slope steeply downwards into an area of deep blackness. The ground around the pit is uneven and rocky, with patches of lighter grey stone interspersed with darker, rougher areas. Near the pit's edge is a large structure built into the ground, made of dark stone or rock, with a wide opening facing the pit. This opening is lined with multiple pointed, tooth-like stone projections. A haphazardly constructed wooden platform made of rough planks and logs extends precariously over the pit from the edge. Scattered around the area are small, glowing points of orange light on the walls and ground, appearing like embers or small magical lights. There is also a prominent circular structure on a stone base near the toothy stone structure, with intricate patterns or carvings on its surface. Other smaller, less defined objects are scattered around, some also glowing with an orange light. The area is lit by numerous sources of orange light, creating a warm but ominous glow.
            * Connections: Connects to UR2 (North-East) via a tunnel and UR3 (South-East) via a tunnel. The Great Pit leads downwards into darkness.
UR5:
            * Description: Located south of UR6 and UR7, this appears to be an open area or large tunnel intersection within the rough-hewn cave system, with a rough, uneven floor covered in scattered objects and debris. Numerous clusters of mushroom-like growths with prominent orange caps are scattered across the ground. A distinct greenish coloring is visible in the air or water in this area, suggesting spores or gas.
            * Connections: Connects to UR6 (North) via a tunnel and UR7 (North-West) via a tunnel. Seems to lead to unnumbered areas to the south and potentially east via tunnels.
UR6:
            * Description: This is a circular chamber located north-east of UR5 and south-east of UR4, within the rough-hewn cave system. It contains several large, oval-shaped eggs with a leathery texture, similar to bird or reptile eggs, situated in rough nests.

            * Description: Located south-west of UR5, this appears to be a chamber or open area within the rough-hewn cave system with a rough, uneven floor covered in scattered objects and debris. A large, dark cylindrical structure or pipe opening is visible on its eastern side. Prominently positioned on the ground between this large pipe structure and the central fire pit is a multi-tiered object made of rough, dark stone. It is wider at the base and tapers towards the top, with etched or carved lines forming simple geometric patterns on its front face. A small, flat, lighter-colored object rests horizontally on its top layer.
            * Connections: Connects to UR5 (North-East) via a tunnel and UR12 (West) via a tunnel. Potentially connects to an unnumbered area to its south via a tunnel.
UR9:
            * Description: Situated in the south-eastern part of the area shown, this appears to be a tunnel section of the constructed sewer system. It features a central walkway made of solid stone or concrete, flanked by U or V shaped water channels containing murky green sewer slurry. The walkway is bordered by solid stone or concrete walls. A visibly caved-in section of the rough stone wall connects this constructed sewer area to the rough-hewn cave system.
            * Connections: Connects to UR10 (West) via a tunnel. Connects to the cave system (UR1, UR2, UR3, UR5) via the caved-in wall.

            * Description: Another constructed stone sluiceway containing nasty, murky green sewer water.
            * Connections: Leads to UR14, a partially collapsed circular room, in the south-west.
UR9c:
            * Description: A constructed stone sluiceway that appears to be dry. It has a visibly mostly collapsed passageway leading to UR12 in the west.
            * Connections: Has a mostly collapsed passageway to UR12 (West). Connects to UR10 via an open sluice gate made of metal or wood, raised above the waterline in UR10.
UR10:
            * Description: A large, rectangular chamber in the southern part of the area shown, part of the constructed sewer system. It features a central walkway made of solid stone or concrete, flanked by U or V shaped water channels containing murky green sewer slurry. The walkway is bordered by solid stone or concrete walls. Murky green water is visibly flowing into this chamber from multiple points, including the channels labeled UR9, UR9a, and UR9b, as well as from a sluiceway in the top left connecting to a corridor towards UR13. Three sturdy, square stone columns are visible positioned down the center of the room on the central walkway. Dark, grayish tentacle-like growths are present, appearing to be attached to the walls around the room. Several constructed sluiceways connected to this room are visibly dry, including the one labeled UR9c. A large cylindrical structure or pipe opening is also visible on its northern side.
            * Connections: Connects to UR9 (East) via a tunnel, UR11 (West) via a tunnel, and UR12 (North-West) via a tunnel. Receives water flow from UR9, UR9a, UR9b, and a sluiceway from a corridor towards UR13. Connects to UR9c, UR15, UR16, and UR17 via sluiceways.

            * Connections: Connects to UR10 in the north via a sluicegate and the Lower Right Quadrant (LRQ) in the south via an unnumbered passage.
UR17:
            * Description: A circular or octagonal chamber with constructed stone walls made of large, fitted blocks, showing some darker patches or stains. In the center of the room is a large, circular metal grate set into the stone floor. Several raised, rectangular platforms or walkways made of stone or concrete extend from the outer walls towards the center, surrounding the central grate. Scattered across the floor and on the raised platforms are numerous skeletal remains. A prominent, mostly complete set of skeletal remains is positioned directly on the central metal grate. Three distinct, rectangular coffin-like structures made of stone or metal are visible on the raised platforms. There is a visible opening or passageway (likely a sluice gate) connecting to UR10 and a smaller circular opening or pipe on one side of the room. A distinct stone statue or sculpture of a creature, possibly gargoyle-like, with visible horns and wings, is crouched down near the bottom edge of the room. It has a mostly collapsed passageway that is a dry sluiceway leading away from the main chamber.
            * Connections: Connects to UR10 through a dry sluicegate above the waterline. Has a mostly collapsed passageway (dry sluiceway) leading away from the main chamber, whose passability is unclear from the map alone.
UR18:
            * Description: Located in the south-western part of the Upper Right Quadrant, this appears to be a circular chamber or room with rough stone walls, similar in appearance to the cave sections. It contains a large, circular opening or pipe structure made of metal or stone in its center. There are scattered rocks or debris around the edges of the room. A simple wooden ladder is visibly attached to the wall, leading upwards and out of the sewer area, presumably to the surface.
            * Connections: Connects to UR12 (North) via the vertical sluiceway. Likely connects to the Lower Left Quadrant (LLQ) to its west and south via unnumbered passages (Specific area numbers needed for LLQ connections).
Review Notes:
The descriptions have been enhanced with more visual details based on the map, providing a clearer picture of each area's appearance for someone without the visual aid. The "UR" prefix has been added to all area numbers.
We still have the need to define the specific area numbers for the connections leading to the adjacent quadrants (LRQ and LLQ) once those maps are available, and potentially assign temporary labels or further describe the unnumbered passages within the URQ if necessary.
Let me know if you'd like to refine any of these descriptions further or if you're ready to move on to the next step!

Area Descriptions and Connections
Based on the provided map image and notes:
LL1:
            * Description: This appears to be a long, relatively straight section of constructed sewer tunnel running vertically along the far left edge of the map. It features a central walkway or ledge made of dark stone or concrete, with channels containing murky green sewer water flowing on either side. The walls are constructed of grey stone blocks, and there are periodic circular metal grates or openings set into the left wall. Roughly constructed wooden walkways made of uneven planks are present around the edges of the water channels, providing a path above the water.
            * Connections: Connects to LL13 (East) via a constructed tunnel. Connects to LL2 (South-East) via a constructed tunnel. This area likely connects to an adjacent quadrant to its west via an unnumbered passage leading off the map edge.
LL2:
            * Description: A circular chamber with constructed stone walls. The central area is a circular pool filled with murky green sewer water. A roughly constructed wooden walkway, made of uneven planks, snakes around the perimeter of the room, providing a path around the central water. Several large, reddish-brown copper or brass pipes are visibly attached to the stone walls, pointing into the middle of this circular chamber. There are also circular metal openings or grates set into the perimeter walls.
            * Connections: Constructed tunnels connect to it from LL13 (East), LL3 (East), and an unnumbered area (South) via a tunnel leading off the map edge.

Review Notes:
The descriptions for each area in the Lower Left Quadrant have been significantly enhanced with more specific visual details based on the map, including materials (stone, wood, metal), colors (green water, copper/brass pipes), textures (rough stone, uneven planks), and specific objects (grates, pipes, furniture, braziers, barrels, chests, bars, statue, ladder). This should provide a much clearer picture for someone without the visual aid of the map.
The "LL" prefix is already applied to all area numbers.
We still need to define the specific area numbers for the connections leading to the adjacent quadrants (URQ, LRQ) once those maps are available, and potentially assign temporary labels or further describe the unnumbered passages within the LLQ if necessary for clarity.
Let me know if you'd like to refine any of these descriptions further or if you're ready to move on to the next step!

This document details the areas and connections within the Lower Right quadrant of the sewer map.
Area Descriptions and Connections
Based on the provided map image and notes:
LR1:
            * Description: This appears to be a relatively short, straight section of constructed sewer tunnel running vertically along the far left edge of this quadrant. It features a central walkway or ledge made of dark stone or concrete, with channels containing murky green sewer water flowing on either side. The walkway is bordered by roughly constructed wooden walkways or platforms. The walls of the tunnel appear to be constructed stone.
            * Connections: Connects to LR9 (South) via a tunnel, and LR2 (South-East) via a tunnel. This area likely connects to the lower left quadrant to its west via an unnumbered passage.
LR2:
            * Description: A circular chamber located in the upper left portion of this quadrant. It has a central circular area filled with murky green sewer water, surrounded by a roughly constructed wooden walkway or platform. Several larger, reddish-brown brass or copper pipes are visibly attached to the walls, with murky green sewer water actively spewing from their ends into this central chamber. Circular openings or grates are visible set into the perimeter walls of the chamber. The walls appear to be constructed stone.
            * Connections: Constructed tunnels connect to it from LR1 (North-West), LR7 (South), and LR3 (East).
LR3:
            * Description: This area is a constructed sewer corridor with stone walls. A roughly constructed wooden pathway or plankway is visible, hugging the south wall of the corridor, positioned above the murky green sewer water flowing in the channel below it.
            * Connections: Connects to LR5 in the south-east via a tunnel, LR2 in the west via a tunnel, and there is a constructed tunnel leading north into the Upper Right quadrant of the map (Specific area number needed for URQ connection).
LR4:
            * Description: This is a constructed, mirrored L-shaped tunnel section with stone walls. It features a large, reddish-brown copper pipe visibly attached to the wall, actively spewing murky green water into the corridor at the south-east junction where the two orthogonal legs of the corridor meet. Roughly constructed wooden walkways or platforms are present along the edges of the corridor, bordering the water.
            * Connections: Connects to LR8 (North-West) via a tunnel, LR5 (North-East) via a tunnel, LR7 in the north via a tunnel, and an unnumbered passage leading off the map to the west (towards the Lower Left map), and an unnumbered passage leading off the map to the South. It is not clear from the map if it is passable into LR5 via the pipe itself.
LR5:
            * Description: A very large, rectangular chamber occupying a significant portion of the right side of this quadrant. It is divided into a grid-like pattern by sturdy stone walls or supports, with each rectangular section containing a pool of murky green sewer water. There are no wooden walkways visible in this area. Instead, the area features a visually distinct green, sticky slime around the edges of the pools and on the stone surfaces, which appears to have a fine, spider web-like quality in places. Numerous dark, grayish squid-like growths with visible tentacles are present, growing from the stone walls and structures throughout this area. Several large, reddish-brown copper pipes are visible attached to the walls and structures, actively disgorging sewer water into this chamber.
            * Connections: Constructed tunnels connect to this chamber from LR3 (North-West), LR7 (West), and LR4 (South-West), and likely to an adjacent quadrant to its right and bottom via unnumbered passages, and an unnumbered passage to the North.
LR7:
            * Description: A complex junction area located in the center of this quadrant, where multiple constructed stone tunnels converge. The area contains sections of murky green sewer water with surrounding roughly constructed wooden walkways or platforms that navigate the junctions.
            * Connections: Connects to circular chambers LR2 (North) and LR8 (South) via tunnels, the large grid-like chamber LR5 (East) via a tunnel, and a tunnel LR9 (West).
LR8:
            * Description: This is a circular chamber located in the lower central portion of this quadrant. It has a central circular area filled with murky green sewer water, surrounded by a roughly constructed wooden walkway or platform. Circular openings or grates are visible set into the perimeter walls. Within the central green sewer water, a distinct object resembling a piano or organ is situated on a raised stone pedestal or platform, with part of the instrument submerged in the water. Three large, dark metal pipes are positioned around the periphery of the room, pointing inward towards the musical instrument.
            * Connections: Constructed tunnels connect to it from LR7 (North), LR9 (North-West), LR4 (South-East), and likely to adjacent quadrants to its West and South via unnumbered passages.
LR9:
            * Description: A curved constructed stone tunnel section running vertically in the left portion of this quadrant. It features a central walkway made of dark stone or concrete, with channels containing murky green sewer water flowing on either side. The walkway is bordered by roughly constructed wooden walkways or platforms.
            * Connections: Connects to LR1 (North) via a tunnel, LR8 (South) via a tunnel, LR7 (East) via a tunnel, and likely to an adjacent quadrant to its West via an unnumbered passage.
Review Notes:
The descriptions have been enhanced with more specific visual details based on the LRQ map, providing a clearer picture of each area's appearance for someone without the visual aid. The "LR" prefix was already added in the previous step.
We still need to define the specific area numbers for the connections leading to the adjacent quadrants (URQ, LLQ) once those maps are available, and potentially assign temporary labels or further describe the unnumbered passages within the LRQ if necessary for clarity.
Let me know if you'd like to refine any of these descriptions further or if you're ready to move on to the next step!

There is a central glowing firepit emitting orange light, providing warmth and illumination to the room.
            * Connections: Connects to UR4 (North-West) via a tunnel and potentially to unnumbered areas to its south and east via tunnels.
UR4:
            * Description: This significant area in the northern part of the quadrant contains a large, dark, irregular opening in the ground (the pit) with rough, rocky edges that slope steeply downwards into an area of deep blackness. The ground around the pit is uneven and rocky, with patches of lighter grey stone interspersed with darker, rougher areas. Near the pit's edge is a large structure built into the ground, made of dark stone or rock, with a wide opening facing the pit. This opening is lined with multiple pointed, tooth-like stone projections. A haphazardly constructed wooden platform made of rough planks and logs extends precariously over the pit from the edge. Scattered around the area are small, glowing points of orange light on the walls and ground, appearing like embers or small magical lights. There is also a prominent circular structure on a stone base near the toothy stone structure, with intricate patterns or carvings on its surface. Other smaller, less defined objects are scattered around, some also glowing with an orange light. The area is lit by numerous sources of orange light, creating a warm but ominous glow.
            * Connections: Connects to UR2 (North-East) via a tunnel and UR3 (South-East) via a tunnel. The Great Pit leads downwards into darkness.
UR5:
            * Description: Located south of UR6 and UR7, this appears to be an open area or large tunnel intersection within the rough-hewn cave system, with a rough, uneven floor covered in scattered objects and debris. Numerous clusters of mushroom-like growths with prominent orange caps are scattered across the ground. A distinct greenish coloring is visible in the air or water in this area, suggesting spores or gas.

            * Description: This is a circular chamber located north-west of UR5 and west of UR6, within the rough-hewn cave system. It appears to be a communal living area. There is a glowing firepit in the center of the room. Wooden crates and a wooden chest are visible, along with a simple wooden table. Near the table are some unclear objects, one appearing red and one green. A set of smith's tools and a stone wheel for sharpening swords are distinctly visible. In the lower left-hand corner of the room, next to the sharpening wheel, are what appear to be two leafy plants or similar growths. A grappling hook is also present on the ground. Roughly constructed wooden walkways or platforms are visible around the perimeter, bordering areas of murky green sewer water.
            * Connections: Connects to UR5 (South-East) via a tunnel, and potentially to unnumbered areas in other directions (North and West) via tunnels.
UR8:
            * Description: Located south-west of UR5, this appears to be a chamber or open area within the rough-hewn cave system with a rough, uneven floor covered in scattered objects and debris. A large, dark cylindrical structure or pipe opening is visible on its eastern side. Prominently positioned on the ground between this large pipe structure and the central fire pit is a multi-tiered object made of rough, dark stone. It is wider at the base and tapers towards the top, with etched or carved lines forming simple geometric patterns on its front face. A small, flat, lighter-colored object rests horizontally on its top layer.
            * Connections: Connects to UR5 (North-East) via a tunnel and UR12 (West) via a tunnel. Potentially connects to an unnumbered area to its south via a tunnel.
UR9:
            * Description: Situated in the south-eastern part of the area shown, this appears to be a tunnel section of the constructed sewer system. It features a central walkway made of solid stone or concrete, flanked by U or V shaped water channels containing murky green sewer slurry. The walkway is bordered by solid stone or concrete walls. A visibly caved-in section of the rough stone wall connects this constructed sewer area to the rough-hewn cave system.
            * Connections: Connects to UR10 (West) via a tunnel. Connects to the cave system (UR1, UR2, UR3, UR5) via the caved-in wall. Likely connects to the lower right quadrant to its south-east via an unnumbered passage, and potentially to other unnumbered areas to its south and east within this quadrant via tunnels.

UR17:
            * Description: A circular or octagonal chamber with constructed stone walls made of large, fitted blocks, showing some darker patches or stains. In the center of the room is a large, circular metal grate set into the stone floor. Several raised, rectangular platforms or walkways made of stone or concrete extend from the outer walls towards the center, surrounding the central grate. Scattered across the floor and on the raised platforms are numerous skeletal remains. A prominent, mostly complete set of skeletal remains is positioned directly on the central metal grate. Three distinct, rectangular coffin-like structures made of stone or metal are visible on the raised platforms. There is a visible opening or passageway (likely a sluice gate) connecting to UR10 and a smaller circular opening or pipe on one side of the room. A distinct stone statue or sculpture of a creature, possibly gargoyle-like, with visible horns and wings, is crouched down near the bottom edge of the room. It has a mostly collapsed passageway that is a dry sluiceway leading away from the main chamber.
            * Connections: Connects to UR10 through a dry sluicegate above the waterline. Has a mostly collapsed passageway (dry sluiceway) leading away from the main chamber, whose passability is unclear from the map alone.
UR18:
            * Description: Located in the south-western part of the Upper Right Quadrant, this appears to be a circular chamber or room with rough stone walls, similar in appearance to the cave sections. It contains a large, circular opening or pipe structure made of metal or stone in its center. There are scattered rocks or debris around the edges of the room. A simple wooden ladder is visibly attached to the wall, leading upwards and out of the sewer area, presumably to the surface.
            * Connections: Connects to UR12 (North) via the vertical sluiceway. Likely connects to the Lower Left Quadrant (LLQ) to its west and south via unnumbered passages (Specific area numbers needed for LLQ connections).
Review Notes:
The descriptions have been enhanced with more visual details based on the map, providing a clearer picture of each area's appearance for someone without the visual aid. The "UR" prefix has been added to all area numbers.
We still have the need to define the specific area numbers for the connections leading to the adjacent quadrants (LRQ and LLQ) once those maps are available, and potentially assign temporary labels or further describe the unnumbered passages within the URQ if necessary.
Let me know if you'd like to refine any of these descriptions further or if you're ready to move on to the next step!




D&D Sewer Map Description - Upper Left Quadrant
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13hMOjemhDDUE7AgeF2LltmGMRR5aXJaNn9vCnPQuteQ/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p
This document details the areas and connections within the Upper Left quadrant of the sewer map.
Area Descriptions and Connections
Based on the provided map image and notes:
UL1, UL1a, and UL1b:
            * Description: These are three connected circular pools arranged vertically along the western edge of the quadrant. Each pool is bordered by rough-hewn stone walls. A large, dark metal sewer pipe is visible in the north, positioned above UL1, appearing to be the source from which nasty green sewer water is actively disgorging into UL1. The green water fills UL1 and flows down into UL1a, and then from UL1a down into UL1b, visually suggesting a tiered arrangement. Each circular area has a solid, grey stone or concrete border around the pool itself. (Note: User suggests these areas could be vertically differentiated, potentially functioning like a boat lock, which could affect water flow.)
            * Connections: UL1b connects to a constructed stone sluiceway to the south. This sluiceway eventually connects to UL3, UL15, and UL5.
UL2:
            * Description: A semi-circular alcove type of room located near the top center of the quadrant, carved out of the rough stone. It contains a simple wooden ladder leading upwards, set against the back wall, suggesting an exit from the sewer system to an area above. Two sets of stone staircases are visible, descending from the alcove floor down into the adjacent constructed stone sluiceway. The walls of the alcove are rough stone.
            * Connections: Connects to UL3 via two stone staircases descending into the sluiceway.
UL3:
            * Description: A long, relatively narrow vertical sluiceway with constructed stone walls and a U or V shaped channel containing green sewer water. Numerous dark metal pipes are sticking out horizontally from the stone walls along the length of the sluiceway, and a nasty, dark fluid is visibly leaking or dripping from the ends of these pipes down into the water channel below.
            * Connections: Connects to UL2 (via staircases), UL5, UL1b, and UL15.
UL4, UL4a, UL4b, and UL4c:
            * Description: UL4 is a large, central circular chamber with rough stone walls, forming the core of a cross-shaped arrangement of four circular rooms (UL4, UL4a, UL4b, UL4c). All four of these circular areas (UL4, UL4a, UL4b, and UL4c) are visibly filled with thick, greyish-white webs that obscure much of the floor and wall details. Areas UL4a and UL4b, positioned to the east and north of UL4 respectively, both have large, dark metal sewer pipes feeding nasty green water into them from the periphery. Area UL4c, to the west of UL4, has many smaller, dark metal sewer pipes protruding from its walls, also appearing to feed fluid into the room.
            * Connections: UL4 connects via passages to UL5 (South), UL5a (South-East), and UL6a (East). UL4a connects directly to UL6a via a passage.
UL5 and UL5a:
            * Description: UL5 is a constructed stone sluiceway with a central walkway and U or V shaped water channel containing green sewer water. UL5a is a smaller, circular annex or side chamber connected to UL5. The UL5 sluiceway appears to connect to a larger, dark metal flowing sewer pipe structure. Multiple dark metal pipes protrude horizontally from the stone walls of the sluiceway, with nasty fluid visibly leaking or dripping from them into the water channel.
            * Connections: UL5 connects to UL5a, UL4, UL3, UL1b, and UL15.
UL6a and UL6b:
            * Description: This appears to be a complex machine room, composed of two interconnected sections, UL6a and UL6b, within a constructed stone structure. UL6a is a smaller entry area leading into the larger UL6b. The room is filled with intricate machinery made of metal components (pipes, gears, tanks) with glowing blue and orange elements, suggesting electrical or aetheric energy flowing through it. UL6b contains a large, prominent metal turbine with visibly spinning blades. The machinery has a somewhat chaotic or "infernal" appearance, implying it is a powerful or unusual engine powering the complex. On the exterior walls of the constructed structure, particularly along the south (adjoining UL7) and east corridors, are visible dark metal pipes containing heated water, and hot vapor is visibly expelling or steaming from vents or cracks in these pipes into the adjoining areas. The overall impression is one of heat, energy, and complex, potentially dangerous machinery.
            * Connections: Connected to UL4 (from UL6a) and directly to UL4a (from UL6a). Adjoins UL7 (South) and an unnumbered constructed passage leading off the map to the East.
UL7:
            * Description: This is a constructed stone sluiceway with a water channel containing green sewer water. Along the north wall of the sluiceway, there are visible dark metal pipes that appear to contain heated water, with steam or vapor visibly rising from them. There is a roughly constructed wooden plankway running along the south wall, positioned above the water channel, allowing passage without needing to step into the sewer water.
            * Connections: Connects to UL8 in the west via the plankway and an unnumbered constructed passage leading off the map to the south east. Adjoins UL6a/UL6b on the north.
UL8:
            * Description: A circular room with rough stone walls. Roughly constructed wooden planks are laid out around the perimeter of the room, forming a walkway that allows passage without stepping into the nasty green sewer water that fills the center. In the very center of the room, where the water is, is a dark metal ladder leading upwards, suggesting an exit from the sewer. Dark, greyish, squid-like growths are visibly flowing or protruding out of the rough stone walls around the perimeter.
            * Connections: Connects to UL7 in the east (via the plankway), UL15 in the west (via the plankway), and UL9 in the south (via a passage).
UL9:
            * Description: This area is a constructed stone corridor that appears to have been converted into living or resting quarters. There is no sewer water visible in this portion of the map. Along each side of the corridor, there appear to be a bunch of small, enclosed booths or cells, separated by wooden walls or partitions. There are wooden structures forming a walkway and partitioned areas throughout this area, creating the individual sleeping spaces. The overall impression is of a makeshift living space within the sewer structure.
            * Connections: Connects to UL12 in the south west, UL8 in the north, and also connects to an unnumbered constructed passage leading off the map to the south (towards the LLQ).
UL10:
            * Description: A circular room with constructed stone walls, appearing to function as a reservoir or collection chamber for sewer water. Multiple dark metal pipes are visible protruding from the walls and pointing toward the center of the room, suggesting they can expel nasty water into it. The room contains green sewer water.
            * Connections: Connects to UL15 / UL8 in the north via a passage. Connects to UL11 via a passage (Note: User suggests this is a secret passage).
UL11:
            * Description: A constructed stone passage connecting UL10 to UL12. (Note: User suggests this is a secret passageway that also connects to rooms in the LLQ).
            * Connections: Connects to UL10 and UL12. Connects to unnumbered constructed passages leading off the map towards the LLQ (Note: User suggests this is a secret connection).
UL12:
            * Description: A small room with constructed stone walls, appearing to be a bedroom. It contains a simple wooden bed, a wooden dresser or set of shelves with various small items visible on them, and scattered items on the stone floor. A rectangular rug with a distinct texture and color is visible on the floor between the bed and the dresser/shelves.
            * Connections: Connected to UL11 and UL9. Connects to unnumbered constructed passages leading off the map towards the LLQ.
UL13:
            * Description: A constructed stone sluiceway that appears to be a dead end within this quadrant. Several dark metal pipes are visible leading from the surface (indicated by circular grates on the map) and dumping sewage water into this sluice way, which contains green sewer water.
            * Connections: Connects to the URQ in the east via a constructed passage (Specific area number needed).
UL14:
            * Description: A circular reservoir type chamber with constructed stone walls. Multiple dark metal pipes are visible pointing inward from the walls, with nasty fluid visibly leaking from them into the chamber, which contains green sewer water. There is a rickety wooden walkway constructed within the chamber, positioned above the water, that appears to allow explorers to get to the base of a ladder that leads upwards and out of this area to the surface (indicated by a grate on the map).
            * Connections: Connects to the LLQ in the south via a constructed passage (Specific area number needed).
UL15:
            * Description: A constructed stone sluiceway containing green sewer water. Roughly constructed wooden boards are laid out across or along the sluiceway, forming a ramshackle passage that allows movement without being fully submerged in the water.
            * Connections: Connects to UL8 in the east (via the wooden boards), UL16 in the south, and Areas UL1b, UL3, and UL5 in the north.
UL16:
            * Description: A constructed stone sluiceway containing green sewer water, appearing to be an extension of UL15.
            * Connections: Connects to UL15 in the north and the LLQ in the south via a constructed passage (Specific area number needed for the LLQ connection).
