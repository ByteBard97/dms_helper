## The Adventure So Far (Highlights: Sessions 1-22)

* **The Calling & First Labor:** Summoned by Kyrah (Goddess of Music in disguise)[cite: 4775, 4787], the heroes proved their worth by slaying a corrupted boar terrorizing the Heartlands. They sacrificed it to Pythor, God of Battle, gaining his favor[cite: 14, 16].
* **Rescuing the Oracle:** They battled soldiers of Sydon [cite: 38, 39] and defeated the sea hag Heleka [cite: 53] to rescue the Oracle Versi[cite: 54]. Versi revealed the **Three Great Labors**: Claim the Dragonlord Weapons, Light the Mithral Forge, and Drink from the Horn of Balmytria[cite: 57, 58].
* **Estoria & Labor Quests:** In Estoria, they met King Pythor [cite: 71] and Volkan (God of the Forge)[cite: 66], learning more about the Labors. Delphi received a prophecy about his lost armor[cite: 62, 63]. They ventured into the Oldwoods, defeated the dryad Demetria, and recovered the **Horn of Balmytria**[cite: 125]. Drinking from it revealed visions of the ghost ship *Ultros* and the Antikythera[cite: 134, 135]. Rhaena recovered a family ring from Demetria[cite: 373, 374].
* **Necropolis & Armaments:** Journeying to the Necropolis at Telamok[cite: 149], they navigated traps and undead guardians[cite: 177, 178, 206, 209]. In Xander's tomb, they battled the minotaur Graxis, negotiated with the undead Dragonlord Xander, and claimed the **Armaments of the Dragonlords** (Xander's Breastplate, Axe, and Shield)[cite: 202, 4420]. Delphi received the Crown of the Dragonlords[cite: 203].
* **Mithral Forge:** Guided by rescued centaurs[cite: 233, 234], they navigated troglodyte caves, dealt with the intelligent Troglodyte King, bypassed traps, battled death dogs and cockatrices[cite: 271, 279, 281], and allied with Pyra the Forgekeeper[cite: 302, 303]. They defeated a young cerberus and **lit the Mithral Forge**[cite: 315], later defending it from a troglodyte assault. Volkan began crafting items for them[cite: 339, 607].
* **Saving Princess Anora:** Returning to Estoria, they discovered Princess Anora was demanded as a sacrifice by Sydon[cite: 71, 72]. They slew the basilisks intended for the ritual, negotiated with Gaius, and offered themselves in Anora's place[cite: 363]. Surviving the night chained to the Rock of Estor against harpy attacks, they saved the princess and averted war with the centaurs[cite: 411, 412]. Pythor rewarded them with his Hammer and swore an oath of service[cite: 412, 413].
* **Mytros & The Storm:** Summoned to Mytros by King Acastus[cite: 2255], they arrived during a massive hurricane sent by Sydon[cite: 2273]. After navigating various proposals, they retrieved the Boreal Harp from the satyr Boreas [cite: 500, 501] and Astreus performed a ritual atop Mount Volkan, dispelling the storm.
* **Intrigue in Mytros:** Queen Vallus warned them of King Acastus's ambitions regarding the *Ultros*[cite: 443, 451]. Aella connected with exiled Amazon Makhaira. They investigated the Cult of Lutheria, discovering child sacrifices, and the Cult of the Snake, led by the Lady of Coins (Moxena). Moxena revealed herself as Aella's relative who saved her life, offering an alliance against the usurpers on Themis in exchange for assassinating Lord Neurdagon.
* **Acquiring the Ultros:** Traveling to the Dead Falls[cite: 609], they boarded the legendary ghost ship *Ultros*[cite: 609]. They allied with the ghostly Thanes against the spectral captain Estor Arkelander[cite: 611], defeating him in a fierce battle. Guided by the ship's dryad spirit, Delphia, they sailed the *Ultros* underwater.
* **Setting Sail:** Returning to Mytros, they received the **Antikythera** from Queen Vallus, who revealed its missing gear (needed for the Forgotten Sea) was likely on the Island of Yonder[cite: 2046, 2049, 2050]. They were warned the Oath of Peace ends in 60 days[cite: 2087]. King Acastus showed veiled jealousy[cite: 639]. Pythor and Kyrah joined their crew[cite: 643, 644]. Versi tasked Delphi with finding a brass dragon egg on Fire Island[cite: 645, 646]. The *Ultros*, crewed by volunteers[cite: 2071], set sail for Fire Island using the Antikythera.
