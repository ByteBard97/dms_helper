+
+13

+
+15

+ Scythra, the Keeper of Histories.
+
+55
+00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,020
+ A deadly fire snake circled her, its heat scorching the earth, while overhead a winged
+
+56
+00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,500
+ pterosaur kept watch.
+
+57
+00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,550
+ Sethith pleaded for help.
+
+58
+00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,170
+ Aayla, you cloak the party in shadow with
+
+59
+00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,509
+ pass without trace. Delphi
+
+60
+00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,670
+ you invoked Bless upon your allies,

+61
+00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,089
+ Then the ambush sprung, Aella, you enchanted chakram, became a whirlwind of mithril death.
+
+62
+00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,410
+ Launched from stealth, boosted by Astraeus' inspiration, it struck the leader before
+

+
+69
+00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,310
+ Sithra was freed
+
+70
+00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,750

+ Grass dragon eggs fate.

+
+75
+00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,149
+ queen. Another track brought
+
+76
+00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,709
+ you to the Bloodscale Village,
+
+77
+00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,430
+ a settlement built on stilts over swampy poles
+
+78
+00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,889
+ dominated by a Moessi ziggurat.
+
+79
+00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,079
+ There, upon a throne of bone and shell, sat Queen Vaitha.
+
+80
+00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,240
+ She welcomed you as prophesied heroes, confirming her struggle against the Sidon-allied King
+
+81
+00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,600
+ Jenkor, who holds the sacred
+
+82
+00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,620
+ volcano. She asks
+
+83
+00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,660
+ you for your aid offering knowledge
+
+84
+00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,639
+ of the dragon eggs
+
+85
+00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,720
+ in a secret path
+
+86
+00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,680
+ into Jhankar's fortress in return.
+
+87
+00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,220
+ and an unsettling cultural proposal that hangs heavy in the humid jungle air.
+
+88
+00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:42,012
+ All right, so you just met Queen Vaitha, and let me bring this on.
+
+89
+00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,851
+ I had to shrink the map so let me
+
+90
+00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,072
+ Let me go back to our map here.
+
+91
+00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:56,132
+ okay we're still on the map
+
+92
+00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,682
+ And I shrunk that down.
+
+93
+00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,502
+ so hopefully it doesn't crash your computer
+
+94
+00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,992
