# Project Progress Note – 2025-05-05 

The D&D Helper refactor is now stable and feature-complete for its **MVP milestone**. This file replaces the old "refactoring attempt failure" hand-off; the blocking UI bug has been fixed and many enhancements are in place.

## Recent Highlights (May 03 → May 05)

| Area | Work Completed |
|------|----------------|
| **Refactor** | MainWindow successfully split into modular controllers & widgets. All signals/slots validated. |
| **Markdown pipeline** | Added `response_processor.py` → detects fenced JSON stat-blocks, converts to HTML, normalises malformed Markdown tables, and wraps them with `.table-5e` styling divs. |
| **Stat-blocks** | Switched from Web-Components to a lightweight **class-based stat-block renderer** (`class_statblock_renderer.py`). Now consumes JSON, outputs semantic HTML. |
| **CSS / Styling** | Integrated a global `css/dnd_style.css` with D&D-flavoured typography and table styling; added zebra-striping for tables. |
| **Streaming** | Implemented streaming Gemini output: chunk-level updates via `response_chunk_received`, replaced by full HTML on completion. |
| **Taskmaster upkeep** | Closed Tasks 22 (D&D Markdown guide), 26 (JSON stat-block system). Cancelled Task 13 (over-broad error-handling). |

## Current Status

* Application launches, logs correctly, and displays LLM output with full D&D styling.
* Stat-blocks and encounter tables render perfectly (including zebra rows).
* Audio playback + Whisper Live transcription confirmed working; transcription pane updates.
* Latency is acceptable (<5 s round-trip on local hardware).

## Immediate Next Task – *In Progress*

We're currently analysing and refining the **TranscriptAccumulator** criteria.  
Goal: ensure the GUI-selected *Min Sentences* value is honoured and prevent early flushes triggered solely by word-count.  
Deliverables will include updated accumulator logic, new config defaults, and revised tests/doc notes.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Implement two shared slots: `zoom_in()` / `zoom_out()` and bind to `Ctrl++` and `Ctrl+–` for both panes.
2. Expose default font size in `config.json`; persist changes on zoom.
3. Update documentation and Taskmaster status.
