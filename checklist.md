# Phase 1 Checklist: Real-time Transcription

- [x] **Research Whisper Implementation:**
  - [x] Identify suitable Python libraries for real-time streaming transcription with GPU support (`WhisperLive` client/server chosen).
  - [x] Determine appropriate Whisper model size (`small.en` selected).
- [x] **Setup Environment:**
  - [x] Create Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
  - [x] Install necessary base libraries (See `requirements.txt` - NOTE: Needs `numpy`, `av`, `websocket-client` added).
- [x] **Implement Audio Input:**
  - [x] Write code to capture audio from the default microphone (Handled by vendored `WhisperLive` client using `pyaudio`).
  - [x] Ensure audio is captured in the format required by the Whisper server (Handled by client).
- [x] **Integrate Whisper Streaming:**
  - [x] Initialize the `TranscriptionClient` to connect to the `WhisperLive` server.
  - [x] Feed captured audio chunks to the server (Handled by `client()` call).
- [x] **Process and Display Transcription:**
  - [x] Retrieve transcription segments from the `WhisperLive` server.
  - [x] Print the transcribed text to the console in real-time (via client's `utils.print_transcript`).
- [ ] **Evaluate Performance:**
  - [x] Test the system by speaking into the microphone (User confirmed working).
  - [x] Assess the perceived latency between speaking and seeing the transcription (User confirmed good).
  - [ ] Evaluate the accuracy of the transcription (User evaluation needed).
  - [ ] *Optional: Add basic timing metrics to measure processing delay.*
