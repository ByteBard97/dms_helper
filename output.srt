1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,169
 Yes, I can hear you, Jake.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,739
 yeah you're fine jake um if you guys had the ability to like speak into the microphone more

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,280
 for me, that would be amazing.

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,210
 All right, heroes, gather round and listen well.

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:34,530
 When we last left off, the legendary Ultros had escaped the spectral clutches of the Dead Falls,

6
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:38,170
 carrying you into the gleaming expanse of the Cerulean Gulf.

7
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:46,490
 Fresh from Mitros, armed with Queen Valis' wisdom and the guidance of the Antikythera, set to the Constellation of the Prisoner.

8
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:53,189
 You've charted a course for the volatile shores of Fire Island, seeking a lost brass dragon egg.

9
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,929
 The voyage began.

10
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,030
 Delphi, you diligently scribe scrolls, preparing arcane power for challenges ahead.

11
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:30,349
 Midway to your destination, a lush, uncharted island rose from the waves.

12
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,489
 Jezerat Zul'haf, the island of the turtle.

13
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,530
 Taking Kyra and the robo to shore, you discovered a place unlike any other.

14
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,189
 Its very stones felt warm, hinting at something ancient.

15
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:50,769
 You found vessels moored, including imposing ships bearing the wolf emblem of Aresia, and inhabitants both strange and intriguing.

16
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,950
 You ventured into a sacred shine bathed in cyan light,

17
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,670
 meeting Malon, the ancient trident guardian.

18
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,810
 He revealed the island's incredible secret.

19
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,330
 It lives! A colossal turtle, a moving sanctuary, offering respite from the nightmares woven by Lutheria herself.

20
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,490
 Next, the opulent trading post drew you in where a magnificent blue-skinned marid, Shazam,

21
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,169
 welcomed you with booming hospitality.

22
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:20,509
 he confirmed the island's nature

23
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,349
 and how it

24
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,449
 out to find it again via the

25
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:25,469
 turtle star, offering it as a

26
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,569
 potential hub between your voyages

27
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,530
 While his magical stop was slim this visit, he presented a crucial quest.

28
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:40,870
 Retrieve fire snake eggs from Fire Island, offering rare treasures like star metal or mithril in return.

29
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:48,990
 He also shared cryptic rumors of flying musicians and a dragon riding commander on Yonder, the Isle of Yonder.

30
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,990
 Your exploration continued.

31
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,229
 you encountered disciplined

32
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,389
 Ariesian warrior monks led by Captain

33
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,530
 Galenus, seeking their own rare

34
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,729
 goods and sharing whispers of trouble and

35
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:07,250
 Themis. You met the enigmatic sea elves Lysandra and Kallir, charting strange shifts in the ocean

36
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,610
 currents and asking for your aid in observing these anomalies.

37
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,449
 Finally, at the Floating Lantern Inn, the proprietor Lyra served you a peculiar Tide Whisperer brew,

38
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,610
 granting fleeting understanding of

39
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,430
 Aquan and strange ocean

40
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,530
 whispers. Before you rested

41
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,530
 soundly shielded from Lotharia's

42
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,310
 grasp, waking refreshed

43
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,389
 with temporary hit points and psychic

44
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,650
 resistance. Leaving the island

45
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,689
 behind, the Ultros finally brought you

46
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:34,310
 to the shores of Fire Island,

47
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,710
 The air hung thick with sulfur, and the jungle pulsed with unseen life.

48
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,719
 No sooner had your boots hit the dark volcanic sand than you were met by Sesseth,

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,439
 A shaman of the Bloodscale tribe, who strangely seemed to expect you.

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,340
 He led you into the humid jungle, a challenging trek for most, though Aella, you move with practiced ease.

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,099
 suddenly danger

52
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,520
 you discovered Fire Snake Warriors

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,840
 menacing a bound blue-scaled lizard folk,

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,120
 Scythra, the Keeper of Histories.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,020
 A deadly fire snake circled her, its heat scorching the earth, while overhead a winged

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,500
 pterosaur kept watch.

57
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,550
 Sethith pleaded for help.

58
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,170
 Aayla, you cloak the party in shadow with

59
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,509
 pass without trace. Delphi

60
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,670
 you invoked Bless upon your allies,

61
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,089
 Then the ambush sprung, Aella, you enchanted chakram, became a whirlwind of mithril death.

62
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,410
 Launched from stealth, boosted by Astraeus' inspiration, it struck the leader before

63
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,170
 ricocheting with devastating force tearing through his guards and even searing the fire snake delphi

64
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,170
 your lightning erupted, blasting the

65
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,329
 remaining foes, the Firewalker

66
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,949
 leader vanished into the jungle.

67
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,110
 the pterosaur fled in terror

68
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,750
 and the skirmish ended before it began.

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,310
 Sithra was freed

70
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,750
 grateful she confirmed the firewalkers

71
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,870
 serve Sidon, hinted at the

72
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,350
 Grass dragon eggs fate.

73
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,050
 one hatched into the enemy king's pet

74
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,009
 and agreed to lead you to her

75
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,149
 queen. Another track brought

76
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,709
 you to the Bloodscale Village,

77
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,430
 a settlement built on stilts over swampy poles

78
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,889
 dominated by a Moessi ziggurat.

79
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,079
 There, upon a throne of bone and shell, sat Queen Vaitha.

80
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,240
 She welcomed you as prophesied heroes, confirming her struggle against the Sidon-allied King

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,600
 Jenkor, who holds the sacred

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,620
 volcano. She asks

83
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,660
 you for your aid offering knowledge

84
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,639
 of the dragon eggs

85
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,720
 in a secret path

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,680
 into Jhankar's fortress in return.

87
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,220
 and an unsettling cultural proposal that hangs heavy in the humid jungle air.

88
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:42,012
 All right, so you just met Queen Vaitha, and let me bring this on.

89
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,851
 I had to shrink the map so let me

90
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,072
 Let me go back to our map here.

91
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:56,132
 okay we're still on the map

92
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,682
 And I shrunk that down.

93
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,502
 so hopefully it doesn't crash your computer

94
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,992
 now you guys see the big

95
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,112
 ziggurat here and all

96
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:08,932
 the lizard folk

97
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,132
 standing around it.

98
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:12,891
 The queen has just told you this is the queen.

99
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,492
 Oh, let me pull up my images here.
