1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Maybe. Still said worse.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,660
 He's around

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,660
 They went to the Cascale, you know, you gotta get them in, apparently.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,480
 They went to the composer and said,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,039
 can you create a score which is just thrashing pounding waves of sonic noise

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,160
 with no malady to it and make it really overpowering so that you feel fatigued

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,519
 after only watching the trailer so that was the brief they gave to the

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,519
 They delivered.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,519
 They absolutely did.

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,019
 We will face this together.

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,679
 For our life.

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,200
 We will fight it together, as a family.

13
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:46,277
 I have that on you.

14
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:52,277
 Mean I feel like they're they're going for all the like tried and tested stuff

15
00:00:53,258 --> 00:01:00,938
 You know family team of disparate heroes having to learn to work together to combat an existential threat all the stuff

16
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:06,537
 this worked for the past 20 years of like superhero movies. They're deploying it here.

17
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:10,037
 I literally have that action figure that they just showed.

18
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,518
 Yeah, like they just put a different costume on the damn thing

19
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:24,397
 Also, you said for the past 20 years, I mean, has it like, well, maybe up until about maybe

20
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:32,817
 2017 I mean I would agree to go as far as 1920 even maybe there's us to fall

21
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:37,778
 apart then yeah but then easily it's because they've tried to thank so much

22
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:42,418
 other extraneous stuff onto it, but I think if you were to drill it down to like that more

23
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:45,837
 or classical message of like a family,

24
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:50,358
 an actual family of people, like trying to work together

25
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:55,358
 with people in fairly well-carved-out roles.

26
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:56,358
 That could work.

27
00:01:56,358 --> 00:02:00,138
 Yeah, well I mean, you know, I don't disagree with you, there's pieces here that could be

28
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:04,617
 part of a great film but it's just I just don't trust them anymore at all. No, no, I think you're

29
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:09,997
 right not to I think you're right not to but if I was to put my my money on any

30
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:13,758
 any Marvel project this year, it would be this.

31
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,157
 It would be Thunderballs.

32
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:20,478
 with. Thunderbolts has this advantage of no one cares about it and no one really knows

33
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:24,598
 much about the characters so what they can do if they play around with them it

34
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,798
 It doesn't matter as much.

35
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,758
 That's what they said about that beetle.

36
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:34,948
 Yeah, but that wasn't Marvel. So I just think with Thunderbolts like there's there's not enough interest either way

37
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:41,788
 So even if it's good people won't care enough to go watch it. So they're probably gonna flop nowhere. What do you yeah?

38
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:46,907
 I have a feeling thunderbolts will be like actually pretty good and no one will see it anyway. I I have that

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,560
 It's such an irrelevant property that there's a possibility that they might do some cool

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,840
 shit with it and then no one will even notice because no one will go to see it.

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
 That's just how I'm thinking.

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
 Okay.

43
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,680
 Okay, they can play around with it. They can literally do whatever they want

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
 No one cares about any of the characters except for Bucky.

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,080
 Like, none of those characters anybody gives a shit about.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
 So they can do whatever they want.

47
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,719
 And one of the best part about that theory is if I'm wrong, no one will notice anyway.

48
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,719
 Dude, it's sort of like no one cares.

49
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,360
 and that's a curvy space it just seems a little kind of weirdly stretched and smooth it just

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,360
 which seems like one or two years away from getting a ticket, you know, invited into space.

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
 Well, it's because she's pushing for it.

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,080
 Like the story for brave astronauts head up into space

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 I

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
 I come back forever changed.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:06,370
 so yeah she's she's probably older than she should be well yeah she's like 39

56
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,370
 Right.

57
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,063
 Yeah.

58
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:11,463
 I think the characters meant to be like mid-twenties, as I am.

59
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:12,463
 So right.

60
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:16,824
 Yeah, they should definitely a Pedro Pascal's what like 50. I don't know he's well

61
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:23,793
 He was like in his 20s, so I don't know but they definitely should have went with a younger fantastic for in my opinion

62
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,793
 Yeah.

63
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,353
 I don't know, we'll see.

64
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,353
 It has to be us.

65
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:47,089
 all this stuff is just like i don't know man like it would have been super impressive 20 years ago

66
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:53,730
 but it's like I've seen it all so many times before. It's got a good visual aesthetic to it.

67
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,730
 I think it kind of has balance in everything. It looks pretty good.

68
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,730
 They're going for the very Clinton 1960s look, which is fair.

69
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,730
 That's when Fantastic Four started.

70
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,730
 We will protect you.

71
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,744
 Okay

72
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:23,024
 Yeah, it still happened.

73
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,024
 I don't know. That's...

74
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:30,863
 I feel like because that's the thing about Galactus is size you get you get one shot to sort of

75
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:36,384
 really make it imposing. Have it and walk like, you know, a smaller Godzilla. It's just a bit like

76
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:45,004
 And so if I was to ask you guys, right, what are you more excited for this or Superman?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,959
 Marvel are gonna have everything invested in Avengers right they'll be

78
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,839
 like oh god we need that to work DC on the other hand everyone's gonna be

79
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,019
 fucking running around in circles if Superman fails and James Gunn will be a

80
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:15,339
 part of like a meeting every hour for the next few weeks if it fails oh yeah

81
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:23,040
 And just before I fuck off, here's a little reminder that the Kickstarter for Trial by Fire still has a couple of weeks left for donations.

82
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,939
 We already reached our funding goal within the first few days.

83
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:33,699
 So big thanks to everyone who donated, and we're now pushing towards our stretch goals to try to produce more and better quality short films.

84
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,699
 So if you're feeling generous and you'd like to support independent filmmakers, not to

85
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,500
 mention take a shot at having your own idea turned into a short movie then

86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,540
 and consider heading to the Kickstarter page

87
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:51,060
 the description and having a look. Anyway, that's all I've got for today. Go away now.

88
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,276
 burgerotic.com

89
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:08,696
 Decades come and go but entertainment is forever or so they thought all the wood used to be where dreams come true

90
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:13,656
 but now it's where dreams go to die welcome to neurotic and this is the top

91
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:15,656
 five murder franchises.

92
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,656
 Yeah, tickets are wearing it!

93
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:19,656
 It's going to be a bumpy ride!

94
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:25,136
 For this list we're going to go over the top 5 blockbuster genre franchises, in most cases

95
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:29,336
 that brought generations of fans together, of all makes, shapes and sizes.

96
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:31,336
 Franchises that have been vandalized.

97
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:37,836
 Suffering and perverted by corporate culture and a never-ending quest to turn art into content.

98
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:41,596
 This wasn't an easy list to put together, but we broke it down to this.

99
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:46,355
 what franchise committed the worst crimes against imagination and we start with number

100
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,355
 5. The Terminator.

101
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:49,956
 Come with me if you want to live.

102
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:05,024
 Some may argue that the Terminator was never a franchise and only a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger

103
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:07,444
 written by James Cameron for two films

104
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,723
 And you may be right after two groundbreaking films
